BHP Copper, part of Australia's Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd, said its San Manuel smelter in Arizona has been restarted and tonnage lost during the shutdown would be minimal.
"It's back on stream - it started up last night and it's running well," a BHP Copper official said on Thursday.
BHP shut the smelter for nine days following electrical problems that resulted from the statewide power outage on August 10. A shutdown was originally scheduled for October but this was brought forward due to the power outage.
San Manuel produces just over 360,000 short tons of anode.  
The smelter produces anode which is converted into cathode at the refinery.
"Through most of the shutdown we were producing cathode because we had anode available. We basically ran down our anode stockpile," the BHP official said.
Refinery cathode output was reduced slightly but will return to full output once anode production catches up. San Manuel normally produces more anode than the refinery can consume.
"The U.S. market is holding pretty strongly, and the rod market is particular is good and cathode is tight," the BHP official said. "Asian premiums at the moment are very strong - $130 a tonne is a good premium even with the Shanghai freight."
Most of San Manuel's cathode production is consumed by BHP's own rod mill.
