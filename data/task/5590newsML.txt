Terra Nitrogen Co said on Wednesday that it has entered into a credit facility based on its accounts receivable, which will result in a one-time third quarter earnings distribution rise of $0.50 to $0.70 per unit.
The agreement is for three years. Terra will receive the amount of its accounts receivable upfront and upon payment will pay the creditor. If the facility is reduced or canceled during its three-year term, the distribution will be reduced, Terra said.
