BZW said on Wednesday it appointed Patrick Lin as managing director and head of fixed income and Stuart Baker as director, fixed income trading, in Tokyo.
"They join Mark Dearlove who recently joined the firm as a director and head of short-dated Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and repo trading," BZW said in a statement.
Lin, 36, will have responsibility for establishing and leading BZW's yen business.
"He was previously managing director, fixed income, at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo, where he developed the yen business and traded yen debt securities globally, as well as managing the regional proprietary trading and customer franchise trading teams," BZW said.
Prior to joining Lehman in 1994, he spent seven years with Morgan Stanley's fixed income division in London.
Baker, 32, also joins the firm from Lehman where he was co-head of JGB trading, BZW said.
"Between 1992 and 1994 he worked on the international yen sales desk at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo, where he was responsible for all yen-denominated interest rate products. He began his career in the fixed income division of UBS in London in 1986," BZW said.
