NOTE - Managing director Ken Saggers said the group had strengthened its position with the solvency margin -- the ratio of net assets to net preiums -- well in excess of 200 percent.
But he cautioned that underwriting margins were likely to come under considerable pressure in the current year as reinsurers' terms were more stringent following extensive recoveries in the last year. Coupled to the current weakness of the rand, claims costs were likely to increase, he said.
