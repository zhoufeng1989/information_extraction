State-owned aerospace group SNI Aerospatiale reaffirmed on Tuesday it aimed to agree merger terms with warplane maker Dassault Aviation by the end of this year, as announced.
An Aerospatiale spokeswoman, responding to an article in business daily La Tribune Desfosses, said, "There is no question of doubting the timetable set by the government. The details will be agreed at the latest by December 31."
The newspaper quoted Aerospatiale chairman Yves Michot as saying the new merged company could start life by mid-1997 at the earliest, after legal formalities were completed.
A statement from Prime Minister Alain Juppe said on July 1 that the technical, financial and industrial aspects of the Aerospatiale-Dassault merger should be completed by January 1, 1997.
The merger is aimed at creating a French national champion in defence and civilian aerospace with annual sales of 60 billion francs and paving the way for a European industrial consolidation.
