Mobil Corp's Australian subsidiary said on Tuesday that Gippsland crude oil was still being piped to Shell Australia Ltd despite earlier statements by Mobil that it was taking proportionally more Gippsland crude to entirely offset Shell's normal intake.
"It's not a total offset. They're (Shell) still getting some (Gippsland crude)," a Mobil spokeswoman told Reuters.
Gippsland crude oil is piped from the offshore Bass Strait fields owned 50/50 by Exxon Corp subsidiary Esso Australia Ltd and The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd.  
Shell Australia has reduced its crude oil intake due to a strike over work practices which has reduced production at its Geelong refinery and stopped distribution from its shipping and Lara LPG terminals.
A Shell spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
Mobil earlier said its Altona refinery in Melbourne had switched to 100 percent Gippsland crude input from its usual practice of supplementing Gippsland crude intake with imports. Mobil has sold a crude oil cargo that it ordered two months ago.
