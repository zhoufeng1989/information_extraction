The U.S. International Trade Commission said Wednesday the Customs Service would impose anti-dumping duties on large newspaper printing presses dumped on the U.S. market by German and Japanese manufacturers.
The ITC said in a release it had determined the printing press industry was injured by these imports, being sold at less than fair market value, in response to a complaint lodged by Rockwell Graphics Systems Inc of Westmont, Illinois.
The ITC did not name the makers of the presses, their value or what duties would be imposed or when.
