Shipping and tank storage firm Koninklijke van Ommeren NV said on Tuesday it had bought a 50 percent stake in Spanish tank storage firm Terquimsa.
The interest was bought from U.S. venture capital group Advent International. The other half of Terquimsa will remain in the hands of Spain's Compania Logistica Hidrocarburos (CLH).  
"This investment will positively affect our net profit in 1996," Van Ommeren said in a statement. No financial details of the transaction were given.
Terquimsa SA operates a terminal in the Spanish port of Tarragona with total capacity of 128,000 cubic metres for the storage of chemicals, mineral oil products and animal and vegetable oils and fats.
Van Ommeren said Terquimsa plans to expand its capacity and will closely cooperate with Van Ommeren's Barcelona tank terminal which has storage capacity of 34,000 cubic metres.
Van Ommeren said it planned to invest a total of 190 million guilders this year.
This was the balance of major investment programmes in tank storage in Asia and Europe, start up costs of a terminal project in Zhuhai in China and the sale of some older tankers.
