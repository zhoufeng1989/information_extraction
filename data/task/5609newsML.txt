United Parcel Service said Wednesday it had placed orders for five new Boeing 757-200's and had moved up its order for a Boeing 767-300 in 1997.
Originally, the Boeing 767-300 was to be delivered in 2000. The Boeing 757-200's are to be delivered in 1998.
The company said the orders reflect an expansion of its domestic and international express-delivery business.
UPS did not disclose the cost of the Boeing orders.
