The number of TEU containers carried by the company in the second quarter (corrects from "carried by the company in the reported period") increased by 5.0 percent and reached 449,900 against 424,980 in the same period last year.
Although the number of containers is higher, the company's income turnover is lower by 0.3 percent against the corresponding period last year due to an ongoing erosion of freight rate levels in most trade areas, the company said.
