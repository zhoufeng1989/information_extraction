Queensland-based nickel producer QNI Ltd said on Tuesday that it expected nickel and cobalt markets to remain volatile in the 1996/97 year to June 30.
Earlier, the company reported a 20 percent fall in annual net profit A$85.89 million.  
In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, QNI chairman Max Roberts said company profitability had been affected by falling metals prices and poor weather conditions that impacted on ore availability.
"Unusually prolonged poor weather conditions at mine sites in New Caledonia and Indonesia also affected ore supply availability and quality that impacted on production at the Yabulu refinery," Roberts said.
He also noted that the group's first income tax expense of A$28.5 million and restructuring costs had also depressed the operating profit after tax.  
"The cost of restructuring operations and maintenance costs associated with the first ever refinery shutdown in June totalled A$9.3 million and also contributed to the decrease in operating profit," Roberts said.
As a result of the refinery shutdown, the company said annual nickel production was down seven percent to 26,637 tonnes while cobalt production slipped to at 1,425 tonnes.
By 2.30 p.m. (0430 GMT), QNI shares were steady at A$2.75 on turnover of 1.17 million shares.
