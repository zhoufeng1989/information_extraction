Crown Pacific Partners L.P. said it agreed to buy a Marysville, Wash., sawmill from Garka Mill Co Inc for about $2.7 million.
The acquisition is expected to close September 16.
Once a planned capital improvement program is complete, the facility will employ about 50 people, including personnel currently employed.
Crown Pacific will supply the mill with logs from its 185,000 acres of timberland located in the Skagit Valley and the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state.
