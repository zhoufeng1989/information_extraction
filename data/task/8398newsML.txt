Swedish industrial gas company AGA AB on Thursday forecast its full year profit for 1996 after capital gains would be around 10 percent lower than 1995 mainly due to a weakening economic cycle and a stronger Swedish crown.  
The company said full-year income after financial items excluding the capital gain was expected to be about 10 percent lower than in 1995 due mainly the weaker economic climate and stronger Swedish krona.
Profit after financial items before the capital gain amounted to 964 million crowns in the first half of 1996 compared to 1.12 billion a year earlier.
The company said this was a 14 percent drop of which about six percentage points could be attributed to the higher crown.
