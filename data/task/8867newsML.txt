Mesa Inc said Thursday its board elected Jon Brumley chairman and chief executive, succeeding Boone Pickens in the posts, effective immediately.  
Brumley was most recently chairman and CEO of Cross Timbers Oil Co, which he co-founded.
Pickens, once a renowned corporate raider, said in June that he would retire once a successor was hired.
He will remain on Mesa's board.
