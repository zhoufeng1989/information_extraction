UroMed Corp said on Wednesday it had received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to market its Reliance Urinary Control Insert in the United States.
Reliance, an alternative to adult diapers, is a small, self-administered, single-use device designed to prevent urine leakage caused by female stress urinary incontinence, or loss of bladder control, the company said.
The insert, which measures one-fifth the size of a tampon, is placed into the urinary channel with the help of an applicator, it said.
A push on the applicator fills the insert with air, so that it acts as a barrier to leakage. When a woman wishes to urinate, she pulls a string, the balloon deflates and the insert is removed.
According to UroMed, stress urinary incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine during coughing, sneezing, laughing, exercise or any other physical activity that increases abdominal pressure.
