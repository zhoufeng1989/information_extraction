An Italian-Egyptian joint venture has found more natural gas in the Port Fouad offshore concession in the Mediterranean, the Oil Ministry said on Tuesday.
The company is Petrobel/Belayim Petroleum, a 50-50 venture between state Egyptian General Petroleum Corp (EGPC) and International Egyptian Oil Co (IEOC), the Egyptian subsidiary of Agip SpA, the ministry said in a statement.
The find is 15 km (eight miles) north of the Port Fouad field, where Petrobel started producing oil and gas in May, and 55 km (30 miles) northeast of Port Said city.
The ministry said a well named Barracuda 1 testedZat 25 million cubic feet of gas a day at depths of between 1,450 and 1,800 metres (4,750 and 5,900 feet). The gas-producing layers are 53 metres (174 feet) thick, it added.
The discovery is the latest in the offshore concessions north of the Nile Delta, an area which oil executives say shows signs of becoming a world-class gas basin.
Earlier this month, Belayim's offshore Darfil-1 (Dolphin-1) discovery well yielded 40 million cfd at a depth of between 1,350 metres and 2,200 metres.
A second test well, Norus-1 (Seagull-1) yielded 29 million cfd at a depth of between 650 metres and 1,650 metres, the statement added. Both wells were drilled in about 30 metres of water and were within five km of the Port Fouad field.
