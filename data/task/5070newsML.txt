Venezuelan bottler Oswaldo Cisneros said he broke with PepsiCo Inc because the U.S. soft drinks giant was not as committed as Coca-Cola Co to his bottling enterprise.
"They didn't want to get on the bus with me," Cisneros told leading daily El Universal in an interview published Wednesday.
In a surprise move Friday, Cisneros set aside his five-decade old relationship with Pepsi and announced he would be bottling for its global archrival Coca-Cola Co. As a result, Pepsi stocks will soon run out in Venezuela.  
Cisneros said the new venture would invest $500 million over the next five years. A $30 million advertising campaign is to begin next week.
Cisneros's move to Coca-Cola after a 47-year alliance with Pepsi is a harsh blow to Pepsi's operations in Venezuela. Its sixth largest market worldwide, Venezuela is one of just a handful of markets where Pepsi has dominated Coke with an 85 percent market share.
Pepsi filed a complaint Monday with Venezuela's Superintendency for the Promotion and Protection of Free Trade (Procompetencia) on grounds the Coke-Cisnero venture creates a soft drink monopoly.
