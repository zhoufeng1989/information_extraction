Engineering and pharmaceuticals trading group Internatio-Mueller NV said on Thursday it expected to post a clear profit rise in the second half of 1996.
"The board expects the second half of 1996 to show a clearly higher net profit than in the same period of 1995," the company said in a statement.
Internatio said in March it expected the 1996 full-year net profit to at least equal 1995's 85.1 million guilders.  
The company's first-half net profit rose by 12 percent to 45.2 million guilders despite a higher tax burden. It paid 14.5 million guilders in taxes, compared with nine million in the first half of 1995.
Internatio said its technical subsidiaries in particular had contributed to the profit rise but its pharmaceuticals unit Interpharm Groep had also substantially increased its results.
Negative impact of government price rulings for prescription drugs in the Netherlands had been offset by Interpharm's increasing market share and a strict cost cutting policy, the company said.  
Partly because of takeovers, Internatio's technical and chemical trading unit posted higher first-half profits but it said its port activities were negatively affected by the current price war in the sea cargo sector.
Internatio said it would strengthen the organisational structure of its port activities and would gradually increase the number of its offices in northwest European ports.
