Swedish forestry group MoDo AB said on Wednesday it expects currency hedging to contribute a gain of about 1.5 billion crowns for full-year 1996 results.
"We have earlier said it would be between one and 1.5 billion crowns. Now we already have 950 million crowns and a better estimate today is around 1.5 billion," chairman Bengt Pettersson told a news conference.
