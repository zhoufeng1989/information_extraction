Statoil said on Thursday it planned to initiate an exploration programme to find additional crude reserves around the North Sea Yme oilfield.
Three exploration wells are due to be drilled in promising prospects close to the main Yme Gamma West field and the Yme Beta East satellite, the company's Status Weekly newsletter said.
The two developments currently produce around peak output of 50,000 barrels per day.
"New discoveries will allow us to extend plateau production and the field's producing life," said Statoil engineer Odd Jan Apeland.
Yme is the smallest independent development to be brought onstream in the Norwegian continental shelf. It, together with the Beta East satellite, has recoverable reserves estimated at 66 million barrels of oil.
Statoil said the first well would be drilled on the Gamma Southeast structure. A second well will be spudded on the Beat West structure, with a third planned on the Epsilon prospect.
