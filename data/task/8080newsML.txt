Turkey's regulatory Capital Markets Board (SPK) allowed brokerage house Erciyes Menkul Degerler to resume its trading activities on Thursday, after three months of suspension, the brokerage said.
The SPK decided last week that the brokerage had fulfilled its requests after its activities were suspended on May 7 due to improper use of securities and breach of rules in loan-based transactions, it said in a written statement sent to the Istanbul Stock Exchange.
Of the 100 brokerages now operating on the Istanbul Stock Exchange, Bogazici and Tur Securities are currently under suspension.
