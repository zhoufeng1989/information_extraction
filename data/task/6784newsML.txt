Qatar Airways expects to add another five destinations to its route network before the end of the year, bringing the total to 31, its chief executive said on Wednesday.
Speaking by telephone from Doha, Sheikh Hamad bin Ali bin Jabr al-Thani told Reuters the two-year-old airline would start once-weekly services to Sanaa in Yemen and Tehran in Iran in November.
"We also expect to announce Frankfurt and Moscow before the end of the year," he said.
