Rogers Communications Inc said on Tuesday it inked a deal with with MDC Communications Corp under which MDC will buy Rogers' wholly held cheque printing unit Davis + Henderson.
Davis + Henderson, the largest producer of cheques in Canada, was acquired as part of the 1994 takeover of Maclean Hunter. The deal is due to close by September 30, and is conditional upon signing a definitive agreement.  
Davis + Henderson is expected to generate revenues in excess of C$80 million in fiscal 1996, MDC said in a separate statement. The unit employs more than 750 people at seven plants in Canada and one in the United States.
The company's U.S. unit, the Check Gallery Inc, operates in the direct-to-consumer cheque business in the United States serving 900,000 customers.
MDC said the revenue from this business is growing at a rate of 50 percent per year. MDC will fund the purchase by bank facilities.
Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.
