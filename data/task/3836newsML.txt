German utility group Viag AG is certain to pay a dividend on 1996 earnings, its management board chairman Georg Obermeier told a news conference on Tuesday evening.
Obermeier said it was "certainly conceivable" that the group would maintain its 1995 dividend level of 12 marks and that a higher payout was possible.
Obermeier also said the company had no plans for a capital increase in the next five years.
