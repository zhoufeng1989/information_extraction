Australia's largest non-bank mortgage lender, Aussie Home Loans, on Wednesday said it had cut fixed interest rates because of the prospect of a further easing in official cash rates after the release of the 1996/97 budget.
"The federal budget has opened the way for...Aussie Home Laons to slash its fixed interest rates in the face of prospects there may soon be another fall in official rates," said Aussie Home Loans managing director John Symond.  
Aussie Home Loans said it cut its two year rate to 8.75 percent from 9.5 percent, three year rate to 8.95 percent from 9.5, four year to 9.25 percent from 9.75 and five year to 9.25 percent from 9.9 percent.
"(Treasurer) Peter Costello's very responsible budget will assist the Reserve Bank to slash official rates by the end of the year," Symonds said in a statement.
The Reserve Bank of Australia cut its official cash rate by 50 basis points on July 31. Costello said on Wednesday that the budget for the year to June 30, 1997 would ease pressure on interest rates.  
The government's budget slashed spending by A$3.9 billion to produce an underlying deficit of A$5.65 billion for 1996/97 ending June 30. This compared with a deficit of A$10.3 billion for 1995/96.
