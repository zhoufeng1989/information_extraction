Boston hopes the next time someone says "charge it," he or she will be using a credit card that contributes a share of its proceeds to benefit the city's neighborhoods.
Teaming up with Citizens Bank of Massachusetts the city introduced Boston Community Card, a VISA card bearing a picture of Boston's famous swan boats. Each time a shopper uses the card, the bank will make a contribution to the Fund for Boston Neighborhoods, a non-profit corporation that holds special events around town.
Citizen said at a Tuesday press conference it expects each account will generate $6 annually for the fund.
"We plan to market this card very aggressively," Citizen Bank President Robert Mahoney told reporters, adding he hopes to have 10,000 cardholders.
The no annual fee card, which carries an initial 5.9 percent annual percentage rate (APR), will be marketed to Boston's 25,000 workers, as well as, the general public, officials said. After the first six months, the APR is set to become 7.9 percent over the prime rate.
