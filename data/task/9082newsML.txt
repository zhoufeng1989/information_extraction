The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) said on Thursday that audit opinions on Regional Resources Ltd and Zenith Concessions Ltd had been qualified.
It said the companies' listings on the Johannesburg Equities Trading (JET) system would be annotated with a "Q" with effect from August 23, to indicate the qualifications.
The annotations would be removed when the companies produced unqualified audit opinions.
The JSE added that the audit opinions of Barplats Investments Ltd and Messina Ltd remained qualified.
