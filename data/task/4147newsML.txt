Applied Materials Inc said it and Belgium's IMEC had entered into a three-year collaboration agreement to develop advanced metallization process technology.
In a statement late on Monday, Applied Materials said the technology was critical to 0.25 micron semiconductor manufacturing.
Applied Materials will install an Endura HP PVD system at IMEC and effective Sept 1996, Applied Materials will become a member of IMEC's Industrial Affiliates Program on Advanced Metallization.
IMEC is an independent research and development organization that develops and licenses microelectronic technology worldwide.
"The Endura HP PVD system includes an advanced sputter etch module, Chorent titanium/titanium-nitride and Aluminum Physical Vapor Deposition (Al-PVD) chambers," the statement said.
The research is being conducted at IMEC's facilities in Leuven, Belgium, by IMEC researchers in cooperation with Applied Materials' PVD Division in Santa Clara.
