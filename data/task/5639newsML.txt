Raytel Medical Corp said on Wednesday that it has acquired the non-medical assets of Southeast Texas Cardiology Associates PA, a cardiology practice in Beaumont, Texas.
Roytel also will manage Southeast Texas Cardiology's medical practice. Terms of the transaction were undisclosed.
"This is the first physician practice acquisition as part of Raytel's strategy to create a network of integrated heart centers and affiliated physician practices across the country," Richard Bader, chief executive, said in a statement.
Southeast Texas Cardiology's nine physicians will continue to practice as a group under the name Southeast Texas Cardiology Associates II PA.
Raytel will assume responsibility for providing office space, marketing and other non-medical management services, and it has agreed to develop heart therapeutic facilities.
