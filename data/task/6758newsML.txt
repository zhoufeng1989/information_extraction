Note - Building materials group Marley Plc said demand had improved in most areas since the beginning of 1996, but "progress is disappointingly slow in the UK."
"Almost two-thirds of Marley's activities are now based overseas; this increases our confidence about the outcome for the year as trading conditions in most overseas markets are expected to remain good throughout 1996," chairman Sir George Russell said in a statement.
