Harrowston Inc said on Tuesday its 65 percent unit Marsulex Inc signed definitive deals to buy the assets of Coulton Chemical Co of Ohio and the shares of Sulconam Inc of Montreal.
The total cost of the two deals will be roughly C$128 million cash, the company said.
The acquisitions are expected to close next month following final due diligence and appropriate consents. The Sulconam acquisition is also contingent on the waived rights of first refusal by existing shareholders.
North York, Ontario-based Marsulex is an environmental services firm which provides removal services for useable sulphur by-products for the mining, oil refining and chemical industries. These by-products are converted into useable industrial chemicals including sulphuric acid, liquid sulphur dioxide and elemental sulphur and then sold.
Coulton operates plants in Toledo and Cairo, Ohio, and provides sulphuric acid regeneration services to oil refineries and chemical companies in the Midwestern U.S. market. Sulconam removes impurities from the process streams of two oil refineries in Montreal, Quebec.
