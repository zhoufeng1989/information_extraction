British firms Cardcast Plc and Card Clear Plc said on Thursday they had agreed to merge in a move that valued Cardcast at about 15.4 million stg.
The merger will take place by an agreed offer from Card Clear for Cardcast.
The offer will be on the basis of five new Card Clear ordinary shares for every two Cardcast ordinary shares. There is no cash alternative.  
The firms said Card Clear had already got irrevocable undertakings for 36.8 percent of CradCast's shares.
The two groups said the merger of their management teams would be more efficient and that the combined company would have the critical mass and financial stability to extend its services and expand internationally.
The two firms specialise in combatting the fraudulent use of stolen or lost credit and cheque cards. "A merger should bring an end to the duplication of expenditure on research and development," the firms said.
