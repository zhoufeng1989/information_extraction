Merrill Lynch and Co denied a report that it was seeking higher fees from mutual fund firms when it starts a program to sell their no-load mutual funds through a Merrill fund "supermarket."
A Merrill spokesman described as "untrue" a report in the Wall Street Journal that it was seeking to negotiate higher fees that it collects from fund companies.
"We are not seeking any enhanced payment from fund families beyond what they are paying other people," the spokesman said.  
Citing industry sources, the Journal reported that Merrill was seeking to collect as much as 0.4 percent point of all new dollars flowing into fund firms through its new program.
The fund companies are holding out for as little as 0.25 percentage point, the paper said.
Merrill currently is planning on expanding its mutual fund offerings, but a spokesman gave few details. "We are in the process of exploring expanded areas of mutual fund selection for clients," said a Merrill spokesman. "The details and timing are not yet finalized."  
"We are looking to have something in place well before the end of the year," the spokesman said, adding that talks are under way with several fund companies.
A Merrill source said the offering would include no-load funds from other firms.
Merrill currently sells a variety of mutual funds, both their own and from other fund firms.
The Journal said Merrill is making little headway in trying to charge fund companies above the going rate for a variety of "no-loan" mutual funds.
Merrill, the biggest brokerage house on Wall Street, is expected to enter the no-load "supermarket" arena perhaps as early as next month, perhaps as soon as after the Labor Day holiday at the start of September, the newspaper said.
