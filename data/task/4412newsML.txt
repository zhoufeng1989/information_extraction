State-controlled insurer GAN jumped up to 6.4 percent on the Paris bourse after a newspaper said savings bank group Caisses d'Epargne was preparing a firm bid for GAN's CIC banking subsidiary.
At 1112 GMT, GAN was up 6.7 francs or 5.33 percent at 132.4 francs per share after trading as high as 133.8 francs.
Volume however was a thin 7,007 shares.
La Tribune Desfosses reported on Tuesday that Caisses d'Epargne, which announced its interest in CIC's upcoming privatisation on August 1, was ready to make a "firm offer" for the regional banking group, of which 67 percent is on sale.  
Analysts noted Caisses d'Epargne had not publicly contested GAN's book value for CIC of 14.1 billion francs for 100 percent.
That would avoid a book loss on the sale for GAN and would mean the state did not have to recapitalise CIC, they said.
Analysts said there was also market speculation that Caisses d'Epargne had been persuaded by the state to make an offer for CIC to prevent it going to foreign buyers.
Such a move would also mean Caisses d'Epargne using its own funds, which would please commercial banks which want to see the savings bank weakened, they said. Caisses d'Epargne has a monopoly on the popular pass-book Livret A savings account.
