Balabac Oil Exploration & Drilling Corp said on Tuesday its shareholders approved a plan to convert the firm into a holding company.
The new company name would be Balabac Resources & Holdings Corp, the statement said.
The oil exploration activity would be relegated into one of its secondary purposes which would include real estate development. All oil-related assets would be transferred to another entity, the company said.
The par value of the company's shares would also be changed to one peso each from the present one centavo apiece.
