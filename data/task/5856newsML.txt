Liberty Life Association of Africa said it was "delighted" with interim results and believed it was on track to achieve further gains after adopting the new Financial Soundness Valuation accounting practice last year.
Announcing the results, chairman Donald Gordon said that, while it was not accurate to compare results with the previous half because of the change in the accounting practise:
"It does give an indication that we still feel we are on track on the financial soundness basis for our target 20 percent growth per annum - which is basically our target growth."
"I think we are on track and we are very delighted with our first half-year results," Gordon said.
Liberty Life's net taxed surplus attributable to shareholders jumped 57.9 percent to 667 cents per share from 422.5 cents per share previously.
Total new business written by the Liberty Life Group amounted to a record 2.297 million rand, representing a 26 percent increase over the 1.817 million rand recorded for the comparable period in 1995, he said.
He said Liberty Life would continue to maintain its standards by selling quality products.
"As far as Liberty Life is concerned we are maintaining our standards...and really we are not going to follow all the speculative approaches that some of our competitors are doing," he said. -- Charles Phahlane, Johannesburg newsroom, +27 11 482 1003
