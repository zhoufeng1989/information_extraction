Shared Technologies Cellular Inc said on Thursday it made a joint marketing agreement with Continental Airlines Inc so that transatlantic passengers may reserve a cellular phone.
The company said it would ship cellular phones or deliver them personally to passengers traveling on the airline in the United Stated or abroad for no extra charge.
The company said it would charge customers a flat rate of $1.95 per minute which includes long distance and roaming charges. To make an international call, customers would use their own calling card or the card provided by the company in the phone package, Shared Technologies said.
No further details of the marketing pact were provided.
