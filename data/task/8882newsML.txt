Bausch & Lomb said on Thursday that it expects earnings before one-time charges to be in the range of $2.20- $2.30 for the full year, below consensus Wall Street estimates of $2.35 to $2.40.
The company said it expects revenue growth from continuing operations in the range of five percent for the third quarter of 1996.
Bausch & Lomb said its outlook is hurt by softness in sunglass sales, primarily in sunglass specialty channels.
The company also cited previously-announced one-time costs of about $5 million, associated with several business restructuring and cost-cutting measures.
