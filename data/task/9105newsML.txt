NOTE - The results cover a 16 month period due to the change in the company's year-end from February to June in line with that of the Pepkor Ltd group of which it is a part.
The company said it was steadily being repositioned from a rural cash and carry wholesaler to a mass discounter in the more populated and economically active areas.
