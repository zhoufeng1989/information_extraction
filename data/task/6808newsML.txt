British Petroleum Co Plc subsidiary BP Oil Yemen Ltd and Yemen Petroleum Company have signed a deal giving BP the right to operate and manage Aden international airport's refuelling depot and facilities, BP said on Wednesday.
"This contract paves the way for investment by BP in new facilities at the airport which will qualify for benefits under the Yemeni investment laws of 1992. YPC will receive an annual royalty for the concession which is for a 20-year period," the BP statement sent to Reuters said.
It said the deal involves a "phased investment of up to $2 million."
