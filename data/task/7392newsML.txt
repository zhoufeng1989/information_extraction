South Korea's Korea Mobile Telecom Corp shares fell 37,000 won to their limit low of 594,000 per share in afternoon trading.
Brokers said large domestic and on-shore funds were seen actively selling the stock.
"Large domestic funds took profit on the shares because the over-all market is doing so poorly," said a Shinyoung Securities broker.
Other brokers said that Korea Mobile was expected to see stagnant earnings growth this year due to increased competition in the telecommunications industry.
Korea Mobile is a long distance and mobile telecommunications service provider.
