Takeover target Arequipa Resources Inc said Thursday it has not been approached by any other bidders since it accepted a C$30 a share bid from Barrick Gold Corp.
"The only reason I told Canada AM that I felt there was still a possibiity of a higher bid is that I continue to believe the company has great assets which should be valuable to another number of major international mining companies," Arequipa president Catherine McLeod said in an interview.
"But we've not been seriously approached by any other bidder since the date of our agreement with Barrick."  
On Thursday morning, McLeod told Canada AM, a morning television show on CTV, there was a 40 to 50 percent chance of another bid appearing on Thursday or Friday.
McLeod clarified the comment later in the day.
"Sometimes a surprise bid comes up at the last minute. We're not expecting one particularly," she said.
"It's always a serious possiblity but we have not been approached by anyone."
A week ago, Arequipa accepted Barrick's C$30 a share offer.  
All Arequipa directors, including McLeod, and some shareholders have agreed to tender about 23 percent of shares under a lock-up agreement with Barrick.
Arequipa has not had a change of heart, McLeod said.
"We're happy with Barrick," she said. "We think it's a terrific company. We can't think of any better gold company to develop our assets."
Under Arequipa's deal with Barrick, Barrick will receive a fee of C$18 million if there is a rival bid of at least C$31.50 a share that Barrick does not match.
Analysts have said only a few companies could afford to match Barrick's offer, which gives shareholders a choice of all cash or a mix of cash and shares.
