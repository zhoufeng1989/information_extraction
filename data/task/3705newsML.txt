Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd filed Tuesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration for up to $1 billion in debt securities.
When combined with previous registrations, the banking group will have up to $1.3 billion in debt securities.
Net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and, in the case of subordinated debt securities, to strengthen the capital base, the filing said.
