German building orders declined further in the first five months of 1996, indicating that a turnaround in the sector is not in sight, the German Building Association said on Wednesday.
The association, Hauptverband der deutschen Bauindustrie, said orders through May fell by a real 7.7 percent in east Germany and 9.8 percent in the west. Staff levels dropped 10.3 percent in west Germany and 9.6 percent in the eastern states.
Industrial building demand dropped by a real 9.8 percent in the first five months while public sector building, hit by government austerity efforts, suffered an 11.5 percent drop in incoming orders.
Only firms active in building family homes had grounds for optimism, the association said, noting that housing approvals in this segment had risen 2.5 percent in the period, indicating an upturn in orders to come.
Home building had also remained stable in the eastern states, where demand rose by a real 4.6 percent through May.
