Premier Laser Systems Inc said Wednesday it has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance to market its teeth whitening system.
Premier said it has already signed a joint marketing agreement with  Stardent International Labs Inc for its argon laser product.
"As this portion of the cosmetic dentistry market continues to grow nationwide we believe that the combination of our MOD laser and commercially available bleaching components will generate measurable revenues," said Chief Executive Officer Colette Cozean.
She said that the Premier system was more affordable than competing products.
