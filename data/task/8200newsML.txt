Imasco Ltd said on Thursday that its 98-percent owned subsidiary CT Financial Services Inc has inked a deal to sell First Savings and Loan Association of Rochester to Marine Midland Bank of Buffalo.
Marine Midland is a unit of HSBC Holdings Plc.
Proceeds of the deal are expected to be more than C$935 million, and include the sale price of C$843 million plus a pre-closing dividend from First Federal.
Imasco said CT Financial will post a pre-tax gain of about C$320 million on the sale. The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is due to close in three to six months.  
"The North American financial services industry evolved quickly in recent years and CT Financial believes the best course of action is to sell First Federal and pursue its U.S. expansion in other ways," Imasco president and chief executive Brian Levitt said in a statement.
