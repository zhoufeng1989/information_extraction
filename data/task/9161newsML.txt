Poland's Banking Guarantee Fund (BFG) agreed to lend Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy (WBK) 8.6 million zlotys to help it take over a branch of the failed Bydgoski Bank Budownictwa (BBB), WBK said in a statement.
WBK said that under an agreement with BFG, the fund would lend it the sum for 10 years at a preferential rate equal to one-third of the central bank's discount rate, now at 22 percent.
Newspapers have earlier reported that WBK wanted to integrate the Bydgoszcz branch of construction bank BBB, which lost financial liquidity in 1995, into its own network.
WBK has also said it needed outside financing to meet BBB's obligations to its clients while making sure its shareholders would not be hurt by such an operation.
The guarantee fund was launched last year with government and central bank start-up capital and is supported by banks' contributions.
It is designed to guarantee individuals' deposits and offer soft loans and other help to institutions willing to bail-out troubled banks.
WBK is 36 percent owned by Allied Irish Bank Plc.
