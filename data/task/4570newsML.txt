The Hong Kong-based Shangri-La Group has opened its ninth hotel in China, in Changchun, the capital of northeastern Jilin province, the Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday.
The new five-star hotel cost $81 million and has 450 rooms, Xinhua said.
The group would open three more hotels in China in 1997 and would have 25,000 hotel rooms and $971 million in investment by 2000, Xinhua quoted company officials as saying.
Meanwhile, booming southern Guangdong province has a glut of hotel space, with barely enough travellers to fill just 210 of its more than 830 hotels, the China Daily said.
