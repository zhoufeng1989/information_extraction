Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Sano Corp said they struck a pact for Bristol-Myers to complete clinical testing and market Sano's transdermal formulations of Bristol-Myers' BuSpar, a prescription drug used to treat anxiety.
Under terms of the deal, Sano will receive payments from Bristol-Myers Squibb including an immediate payment of $15 million and would then receive additional payments upon BuSpar reaching certain clinical and regulatory milestones. Provided all milestones are achieved, the premarketing value of the agreement is about $40 million, the companies said.  
Sano also will manufacture transdermal BuSpar for Bristol-Myers and receive a percentage of transdermal BuSpar net sales.
BuSpar is an oral treatment for anxiety and is used in many countries as a three-times daily treatment. It was recently approved in the United States as a twice-daily treatment, the companies said.
Sano has developed transdermal patches of BuSpar, which are currently in Phase III clinical trials.
