Pioneer International Ltd said on Wednesday it is still seeking acquisition opportunities in its core building materials operations.
Pioneer has said previously it could make an purchase of up to A$1.0 billion.
"We are assessing a wide range of expansion opportunities, encompassing add-on acquisitions, new country entries and larger acquisition opportunities," managing director John Schubert said in a statement accompanying Pioneer's 1995/96 year results.
