Japanese credit association Omagari Shinkin Bank said on Wednesday that it was seeking a merger with financially troubled credit association Noshiro Shinkin Bank.
Both are located in Akita Prefecture.
Omagari Shinkin had a meeting of its major investors earlier in the day in order to explain the plan, a senior Omagari official said. "We expect the decision to come in September," he said.
Last May, depositors rushed to remove funds from Noshiro due to rumours it would be liquidated.
If the merger goes ahead, about four billion yen in problem loans held by Noshiro would be written off under the support of the Zenshinren Bank, a central organisation of credit associations, sources said.
Credit associations, or shinkin banks, are small financial institutions which lend money mainly to members.
Noshiro Shinkin Bank, which mainly serves the lumber-processing industry, has been hard hit by the industry's slump since the late 1980s.
