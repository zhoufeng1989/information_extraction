NBC, the television unit of General Electric Co, and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd, parent of Panasonic consumer electronics, are expected to begin a video display project in New York City's Times Square.
A spokesman for the cable TV network CNBC, which will also be involved, declined to answer questions other than to say CNBC president Bill Bolster, Panasonic executive Steve Bonica and New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani and others are scheduled to speak at a news conference at 1045 EDT/1445 GMT Wednesday.
The project is expected to rival the Times Square video display of Sony Corp.
