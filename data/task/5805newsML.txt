British bus and rail operator Stagecoach Holdings Plc said on Wednesday it had received 100 percent acceptances from shareholders in railway rolling stock company Porterbrook for its offer for the firm.  
Stagecoach announced a 476 million stg agreed bid for Porterbrook Leasing Co MEBO Ltd late last month.
Porterbrook is one of three rolling stock leasing operators, known as Roscos, which were among the first major parts of state-owned British Rail to be privatised in 1995.
Stagecoach said details of acceptances made under a loan note alternative, an additional cash alternative and an additional share alternative would be announced "when the offers become unconditional in all respects".
This is expected to be on August 28, it added in a statement.  
Stagecoach said that each of the offers have been declared unconditional as to acceptances but added that the offers remain conditional on the outcome of extraordinary general meetings of both Stagecoach and Peterbrook on August 27.
