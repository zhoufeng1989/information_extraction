Yves Michot, the new chairman of France's state-owned aerospace group SNI Aerospatiale, expects the planned merger with combat plane maker Dassault Aviation could take place by mid-1997.
Business daily La Tribune Defosses in an interview with Michot quoted him as saying, "The new company will start life at by mid-1997 at the earliest, optimistically speaking, by the next Le Bourget (Paris) air show."
The show, which has been Michot's responsibility up to now, is due to be held next June and is a major date in the world industry calendar.  
The government has asked for the Dassault merger to be agreed by January 1, 1997 but Michot thought legal formalities, such as the 45-day merger notice period, shareholder meetings and parliamentary and Privatisation Commission hearings, would take three to five months before the deal is completed.
Michot also wants to push ahead with planned missile and satellite joint ventures with Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG (Dasa), which have lost momentum recently. A meeting with Dasa chairman Manfred Bischoff in September should clarify the situation, the newspaper report said.
Cuts in the French and German defence budgets have weighed on these projects.
Michot is determined that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the conversion of Airbus Industrie from a partnership into a joint stock company should be completed by the end of this year, the newspaper reported.
The MOU should set out the precise tasks for each of the four partners -- Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc, Dasa and Casa of Spain, he said.  
Michot believed that France has played a major role in the Airbus conversion, contrary to conventional wisdom, and he wanted to keep up speed on the project, the report said.
The government named Michot as Aerospatiale chairman on August 7, after it moved his predecessor, Louis Gallois, to head the state-owned SNCF rail operator on July 24. Michot was previously managing director at Aerospatiale.
