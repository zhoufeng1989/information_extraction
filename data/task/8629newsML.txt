The Budapest Stock Exchange (BSE) confirmed floor traders' information and said trading in the shares for hotel chain Danubius was suspended for Thursday.
"The reason is a news in daily newspaper Nepszabadsag which said that (Hungary's state privatisaton agency) APV sells HungarHotels to Danubius," a BSE spokeswoman told Reuters.
The bourse official said Danubius itself could not confirm the news.
"At this moment one cannot decide whether the news is true or not and this seriously influences the price of the share," she said. "That's why we suspended it for today."
Danubius was unable to confirm the news of the tender decision to Reuters.
Nepszabadsag reported today that the board of APV declared Danubius as the winner for the privatisation tender of Hungaria Szalloda Rt (former HungarHotels) at its meeting on Wednesday.
According to Nepszabadsag Danubius submitted the highest bid, offering more than eight billion forints for the chain which has 14 hotels.
Including the sale of Danubius employee shares APV will raise 8.8 billion forints, Nepszabadsag said.
APV will hold its regular press conference later today.
