German chemicals group BASF AG should achieve 1996 net and pre-tax profits slightly higher than year-earlier earnings, group chief financial officer Max Dietrich Kley said on Thursday.
In a speech for delivery at a news conference in London, Kley said that this forecast might prove very conservative, given the chance for an upturn in the German economy.  
"According to our current projection, we are assuming that both profit before taxes and net income after taxes for total 1996 will be slightly higher than in 1995," Kley said.
"If there would be an economic upswing in the second half of the year, which is expected by some of our competitors, surely our prediction of today is very conservative," he added.
BASF earlier reported a rise in first-half pre-tax profit to 2.323 billion marks from 2.025 billion, boosted by favourable currency developments and better performances at its pharmaceuticals, oil and gas and crop protection businesses.  
The crop protection activities will contribute less to second half profits due to the seasonal pattern in this sector, executive chairman Juergen Strube told reporters here.
The first half profit rise was achieved despite lower results in the chemicals business where prices have fallen sharply, partly due to customers running down their stocks.
But Strube, who noted rising orders in most business areas in July, said he believed the de-stocking process had stopped as economies were picking up.
"My overall impression is that de-stocking is coming to an end. Many customers will be enhancing their stock levels to accommodate for additional orders they are expecting," he said.
"The overall business climate in central Europe is improving," he told Reuters.
