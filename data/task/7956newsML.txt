Traded options in BAT Industries were active on Thursday as traders took positions while the underlying shares plunged, dealers said.
A belief that, given time, shares in the tobacco-to-insurance group will recover, may have been the reason why one trader bought 1,500 April 460 calls at 25p. Another deal was to buy 1,000 lots in the same series at 27p.
By 1505 GMT, BAT shares were down 21p to 425p.
There was also a seller of a calendar put spread which was established by selling 250 November 500 puts at 74-1/2p and buying 250 January 500 puts at 74p for a net credit of 1/2p.  
This is effectively like having a long put position for next to nothing.
The deals in BAT were prompted by expectaions of stringent moves in the U.S. concerning tobacco companies.
The main trade in supermarket chain Asda Group was the purchase of 1,000 April 180 calls at 8-1/2p. The shares added a penny to 119p and they will go ex-dividend by 1.93p net of basic tax on Monday.
Also active was insurer Prudential Corp  with the November 460 calls particularly in demand from traders buying in lot sizes of 200, 250 and 400 at prices from 12p to 15p.
Prudential shares raced up 18p to 443p ahead of the insurance sector reporting season in September.
Elsewhere, there was a short strangle in retailer Kingfisher achieved by selling 300 February 650 puts at 28p as well as 300 February 700 calls at 24-1/2p.
Kingfisher was 8p better at 668p.
Over in food manufacturer United Biscuits, there was a buyer of 500 November 220 calls at 6-1/2p. The shares added 2p to 211p.
