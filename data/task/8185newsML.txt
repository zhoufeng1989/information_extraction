Caledonia Mining Corp said Thursday it has made a significant copper and cobalt discovery in Zambia.
The deposit is in Caledonia's Kadola licence area about 40 km south of Luanshya and the Zambian Copperbelt.
The company said 12 out of 15 shallow reverse circulation holes drilled across a geochemical anomaly have struck significant copper and cobalt oxide mineralization.
The company drilled an area measuring 2.5 km by about 0.5 km.
Five holes ended in oxidized mineralization, Caledonia said.
Caledonia has been exploring in Zambia for about two years and has made three cobalt oxide discoveries in its Nama licence area to the northwest of the Copperbelt.
