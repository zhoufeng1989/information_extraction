Moody's Investors Service said on Tuesday that it had assigned its Ba2 rating to Suntory Ltd's 10 billion yen worth of Japanese domestic bonds due 2001.
Moody's also assigned the same rating to Suntory's Euro medium term note (MTN) programme jointly run by its unit Suntory Capital Inc, under which the issuers may issue notes up to a maximum aggregate amount of $1.0 billion.
It expects Japan's distilled spirits market, Suntory's mainline business, to stay sluggish and returns from the firm's beer business will remain unimpressive. Thus, improvements in Suntory's capital structure are likely to take time, it said.
