Swedish commercial bank Nordbanken Wednesday reported an 18 percent rise in profits for the first half of the year and the normalisation of credit losses that have plagued it for years.
The state-controlled bank said operating profits rose 3.8 billion crowns ($576 million) for the first half of the year from 3.21 billion crowns ($486.7 million) in the same 1995 period.
Credit losses fell to 260 million crowns ($39.4 million) from 661 million ($100.2 million) last year, largely due to the exploitation of a loan loss provision of 300 million crowns ($45.5 million).
However, even without this provision, credit losses would have totalled no more than 0.49 percent of total lending, a level which signals that Nordbanken -- along with other Swedish banks -- has returned to normal loan loss levels of around 0.5 percent.
However, the improvement on the bottom line was by no means exclusively the result of lower credit losses, Nordbanken said.
A steady decline in market interest rates over the period had boosted profitability, it said.
While personnel costs rose to 1.43 billion crowns ($216.8 million) from 1.38 billion ($209.2 million) last year, a fall in other operating costs meant a 6 percent decline in total expenses to 3.58 billion crowns ($542.8 million).
Since the credit crash of the early 1990s which brought many Swedish banks to the finance ministry for help, the industry has staged a strong recovery.
Nordbanken was virtually stripped of a massive portfolio of bad debt and non-performing loans in a government rescue package, and its highly profitable core operations have now come back into their own.
Nordbanken's after-tax profit of 2.68 billion crowns ($406.4 million) for the first half means a return on equity of a solid 28 percent.
