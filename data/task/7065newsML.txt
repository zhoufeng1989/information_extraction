Air Atlantic, a predominantly cargo carrier based on Spain's Canary Islands, is planning to expand its fleet and begin regular passenger services, its director Eduardo Gomez said on Wednesday.
The company operates three Fairchild Metros and intends to acquire a fourth, Gomez told Reuters.
It already has agreements with tour operators to run regular inter-island services, likely to start next month, and further ahead would like to increase its links with neighbouring Morocco.
Technically these are charter flights but they will be at regular times and tickets will undercut those of Iberia's regional subsidiary Binter by 10 or 15 percent, Gomez said.
The privately-owned company's business is now 75 percent regional cargo, typically imports of Moroccan shellfish or mail and medicines moving between the islands.
Its aircraft can carry 19 passengers or up to 2.3 tonnes of cargo each and are now performing around 16 flights a day between them. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel +44 171 542 8982 Fax +44 171 542 5017
