First quarter profits at Nigeria's FSB International bank rose sharply to 76.5 million naira ($963,000) after tax in the three months to March 1996 from 10.6 million naira a year earlier.
"Essentially this is the result of restructuring since November 1995, appointing new people, examining the internal framework and refocussing on relevant business areas," a senior FSB official said.
"We believe all banks should be doing better and expect to improve results still further by the end of the year."
Gross earnings rose to 255.9 million naira from 114.0 million naira in 1995.
Pre tax profits stood at 112.4 million naira from 20.7 million naira the year before, while taxation was 36.9 million naira against 9.1 million naira.
