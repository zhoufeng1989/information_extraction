Austria Mikro Systeme (AMS) micro-chip producer dipped over five percent on Tuesday as investors showed disappointment with first half results released earlier in the day, dealers said.
"AMS is a surprise. Three million losses for the whole group looks quite weak and it explains the sell-off," a dealer at an Austrian bank said.
AMS posted a first half group pre-tax loss of 3.1 million schillings. 1995 figures were not available because of business consolidation over the past year with two major acquisitions.
"Because of the low liquidity, the share price tends to oscillate a lot on any news. It tends to go up or down 10 to 15 percent on a given day just like that," a trader said.
Dealers expected AMS to slip further over the next few days as investors continued to sell in response to the first half results.
At 0810 GMT AMS was the leading decliner among the Vienna's stock exchange's blue-chip stocks, down 46 schillings, or 5.83 percent to record a new low for the year at 743 schillings. -- Caroline Drees, Vienna newsroom +43 1 531 12 257
