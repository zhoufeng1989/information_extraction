BFGoodrich Co said on Tuesday that Westlake Monomers Corp had exercised its right to terminate an agreement to purchase BFGoodrich's chlor-alkali and olefins facilities in Calvert City, Ky., for $170 million.
BFGoodrich said the facilities have been the subject of a lawsuit and subsequent arbitration that Westlake initiated in 1993 seeking up to $350 million in damages.
According to BFGoodrich, Westlake's decision not to purchase the facilities has the effect of terminating all of its claims in the lawsuit and arbitration.
BFGoodrich said it will continue to operate the facilities, which produce chlorine, caustic soda, hydrogen, ethylene, propylene and other olefins.
