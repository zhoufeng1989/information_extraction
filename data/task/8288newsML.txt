Boston Chicken Inc said Thursday it plans to open about 2,700 new Boston Market stores over the next five to seven years, an increase from previous plans for about 900 additional stores.
The expansion would bring to 3,600 the total number of Boston Market stores in the United States.  
The company said its developers are using private equity financings to fund the expansion.
Boston Chicken said the plan calls for an annual development pace of 300 to 350 stores in 1997, up from a current development rate of 250 to 275. That rate could increase further in 1998, the company said.
