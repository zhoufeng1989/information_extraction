The head of Hong Kong's only all-cargo airline AHK Air Hong Kong Ltd said he is applying for a licence to start flying to the South Korean capital, Seoul.
In an interview with Reuters, Stanley Hui, AHK's chief operating officer said he does not expect any problems in permission being granted.
He said he is initially considering a twice-weekly service combining with the carrier's current service to Osaka in Japan.
Seoul will also be a technical stop for AHK's new service to Chicago via Anchorage which starts on next Sunday, August 25
Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, which owns a 75 per cent stake in the cargo airline, has handed over the route to AHK as it is concentrating on stepping up its own cargo flights to New York.
AHK is taking delivery of three converted Boeing 747-200 Combi aircraft with 100 tons cargo capacity for the twice weekly service to Chicago. This will be increased to three times a week in mid-October,Hui added.
The airline also has a European service to Brussels and Manchester via Dubai.
Hui said the return flight from Chicago will refuel in Anchorage and Osaka in Japan. Seoul would be cheaper but it has a curfew while Osaka's Kansai airport is open 24 hours, he explained.
He added that Hong Kong's route granting body, the Air Transport Licensing Authority, will publish the Seoul licence application on Friday.
"We don't expect any problems and it should get through quite easily within a couple of weeks," he said. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017
