Swedish construction company Skanska AB said on Wednesday it had won a school construction order in northern Stockholm to a value of 187 million crowns.
"This is not only a great pleasure for us but it is also an interesting concept which could mean more opportunities for us in the future," Skanska said in a statement.
The project involves building one new school and removating five others.
