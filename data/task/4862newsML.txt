    Group pre-tax profit		     61	vs 83
    Group sales				  1,818   vs 1,633
NOTE - Full name of the German haircare products manufacturer is Wella AG. The company said its pre-tax profit of 83 million marks in the first half of 1995 was boosted by 35 million marks due to the release of provisions not required.  
    Domestic sales			     574     vs 533
    Sales abroad				 1,244   vs 1,100
    Fixed asset investments		  49	vs 50
    Employees on June 30		     16,100  vs 16,400
NOTE - Wella said the first six months had been very succesful both in terms of sales and profits. It said its sales growth of 11.3 percent outstripped market growth of less than three percent. It said it had not included non-core business in the first-half accounts becuase of restructuring measures. On a comparable sales basis, sales would have risen by 12.2 percent.
Wella also said it achieved an increase of 7.9 percent in sales to hairdressers despite a stagnating hairdressing market. That exceeded a planned sales rise of five percent. Its sales of haircare products to retailers jumped 21.3 percent, well above expectations.
Sales of scents and cosmetics rose 12.4 percent in the first half due to successful product launches in that business, Wella said.
