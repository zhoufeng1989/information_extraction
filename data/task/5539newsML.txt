Unocal Corp will shut a crude unit early Thursday at its roughly 125,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Carson, Calif., to repair a faulty pump, a spokesman said.
"(We) expect to have it on line in three days," he said.
He said the pump problem was not caused by last week's power outage, and that Carson was not affected by the event, which hampered output at several California refineries.
The unit processes 125,000 of crude oil daily, the refinery's total crude capacity.
