Trading of Guangdong Investment Ltd shares and derivative warrants was suspended on Tuesday afternoon at the company's request pending an announcement, the Hong Kong stock exchange said.
The shares last traded at HK$5.35, down HK$0.20.  
Brokers noted speculation that the suspension was related to a share placement designed to finance its projects.
A sales manager at a regional brokerage said that according to one rumour the shares were being placed at about HK$5 per share. Another trader said some 80 million shares were thought to have been placed at HK$5.22.
This month, Guangdong Investment said it would invest HK$750 million through 1997 in new projects and plant expansion in Guangdong province.
Guangdong Investment officials were not available for comment.
