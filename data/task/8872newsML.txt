The Federal Aviation Administration said it would hold a briefing at 1400 EDT (1800 GMT) on Thursday to announce proposed changes to the flight control systems of the widely-used Boeing Co 737 aircraft.
Following several unexplained crashes of 737s, the FAA earlier this year conducted a five-month investigation of the plane's control systems, but found nothing that could be blamed for the accidents.
The study, however, called for some modifications of the systems, to be announced on Thursday.
Officials said that none of the modifications were considered urgent, with airlines in some cases being given up to 18 months to make the changes.
