The stock of Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) resumed trading on Wednesday at 22.70 ringgit, up 20 cents.
Shares of the country's largest bank were suspended on Tuesday pending the later release of its full-year earnings results, which came in a shade above market expectations.
At 0133 GMT, its stock was trading at 23.10, up 60 cents.  
Maybank on Tuesday reported a net profit of 1.07 billion ringgit against 863.53 million ringgit in the prior year. The market had expected a net profit of around 1.04 billion.
In addition, Maybank executives on Tuesday dispelled recent concerns about its exposure to loans from troubled companies Perwaja Steel and Amcol Holdings Ltd, saying the provisions are "insignificant."
Worries that Maybank had raised its loan loss provision for both companies had prompted recent speculation that its full-year results would fall under estimates.
Maybank "proved all critics wrong," a research note from Jupiter Securities said on Wednesday, adding that it expects the bank to "easily" achieve an average growth rate of 15 percent per annum over the next two financial years.
