Robbins & Myers will grant the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional $5 million of the notes to cover over-allotments, the company said.
Schroder Wertheim & Co, Robert W. Baird & Co and First Analysis Securities Corp will be the managing underwriters of the offering, the company said. Proceeds will be used to repay certain indebtedness, the company said.
