-- Oppenheimer & Co analyst R. Scott Graham confirmed he raised his rating on Black and Decker Corp to buy from outperform, saying a meeting with management last week raised his level of conviction about the company.
"There are lots of new, innovative, margin-enhancing products and the company is continuing to take down its cost structure," Graham said.
"It has emerging market play and is driving cash flow to levels we have not seen in this company for over a decade. This is a big part of paying down its debt, which has been a penalizer of its multiple."
