Celox Laboratories Inc said Wednesday it recently received a notice of allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a patent covering ViaStem, its bone marrow transplantation product.
The company said it expects to receive the patent within the next two months.
ViaStem was developed to improve the storage of stem cells from bone marrow or peripheral blood while a patient receives chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment for immunologic disorders or malignant disease.
It added that ViaStem could potentially be used in other clinical situations including preservation of umbilical cord blood and platelets.
