Shares in Zeneca Group surged to a record in pre-market dealings as speculation about a merger heated up, traders said.
The shares were up 19p to 1533p.  
Talk that Natwest issued a buy note on Zeneca also bolstered the shares, they said. Natwest declined to comment.
The entire British pharmaceutical sector was lifted yesterday by the recurring bid rumours. The latest talk involves Swiss giant Roche Holding AG.
But today, Zeneca appeared to move alone, leaving behind Glaxo Wellcome, which was only up 5p to 918p, and SmithKline Beecham, down 1p to 742p.
"It's just more of the same bid rumours and it seems to be coming from the States," said one market-maker.  
Zeneca's ADRs jumped $1-5/8 to $71 in the U.S. after a strong performance in London yesterday. ADRs in Glaxo and SmithKline rose fractionally.
