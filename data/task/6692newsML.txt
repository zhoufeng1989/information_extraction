The Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) said on Wednesday it had backed $125 million in loans to help finance major orders won by UK companies in the Chinese power sector.
The loans support contracts awarded to Mitsui Babcock Energy Ltd (MBEL) and Black and Veatch Ltd by China's Huaneng Power International Inc.
ECGD, Britain's official export credit agency, said MBEL will design, supply and supervise the installation of a boiler plant and ancillary equipment for two 350 megawatt coal-fired power stations to be built in the Fujian and Jiangsu provinces.
MBEL, granted $95 million in loans, is in a consortium with Siemens of Germany which will supply the turbines for the project, the ECGD said in a release.
Black & Veatch, granted $30 million in loans, is to supply plant for the two coal-fired stations.
