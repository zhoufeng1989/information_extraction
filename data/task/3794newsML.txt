Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co Inc said on Tuesday it received Food and Drug Administration approvals for two Thioridazines Hydrochloride Oral Solutions, both equivalent to Mellaril solutions manufactured by Sandoz AG's Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp.
Hi-Tech Pharmacal said the Thioridazine approvals should help the company penetrate the hospital and nursing care markets where these items are widely used.
