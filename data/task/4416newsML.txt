Italian energy group Eni said it had sold more than 20 million ordinary shares, or some five percent, in its oilfield services arm Saipem.
Eni said in a statement it had reduced its stake in the company to 75 percent but did not say exactly when the shares were sold on the Milan bourse.  
"The sale of the Saipem stock forms part of Eni's strategy of enlarging the share of (Saipem) on the market and thereby increasing its liquidity," the Eni statement said.
The Saipem shares were held by Eni units Agip, Snam and Sofid, the statement said.
Saipem shares have surged since the start of the year, trading at 6,630 lire at the time of the Eni announcement against a year low of 3,390 lire recorded on January 16.
