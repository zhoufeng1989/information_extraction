Argosy Gaming Co said Wednesday that the Indiana Gaming Commisson extended for 180 days its certificate of suitability for Argosy's Lawrenceburg, Ind. joint venture project.
The certificate was extended effective August 20.
In July, Argosy said its Indiana license was challenged.  
Argosy said construction of temporary Lawrenceburg facilities is on schedule for completion this November. The company said it anticipates opening its facilities once the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers issues a permit for a permanent site and the Indiana Gaming Commission issues a final gaming license.
The Indiana Gaming Commission confirmed that it extended Argosy's certificate for Lawrenceburg.
The commission also said it rejected an application by Shilling Casino Corp, doing business as Empire Casino & Resort, that had sought to revoke Argosy's certificate.
