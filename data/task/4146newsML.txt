Freight forwarder Air Express International said it has been awarded a multimillion-dollar contract to handle the air and ocean freight movements from Europe of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
Air Express said the contract covers the shipping of bulk finished pharmaceuticals and chemical products, ranging from infant feeds to hair dye.
The U.S.-based freight forwarder said it will be responsible for the movement of goods from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Denmark and Italy to destinations in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Egypt, South Africa and eastern Asia.
About two thirds of the goods will move by sea, said AEI.
