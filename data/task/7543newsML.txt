NOTE - Full name of the German steel and engineering group is Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp.
The company said in a statement that all six business divisions were profitable in the first half of the year. The decline in pre-tax profit in the period was attributed to the weak overall economy, which had a strong impact on the steel industry and related sectors, it said.
Of total investment in the first half, 1.1 billion marks were spent on acquisitions and 400 million marks on investment in plant. As a result, Krupp said financial debt rose to correspond with business volume.
