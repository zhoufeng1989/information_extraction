--Vector Securities International analyst Peter Ginsberg said he raised his fiscal 1997 earnings estimate for Dura Pharmaceuticals Inc to $0.87 per share from $0.66, and raised his 1998 estimate to $1.17 from $0.83.
--Shares in the San Diego-based drug concern were up 5-1/4 to 32 after Dura said it would buy the marketing rights to two antibiotics -- Ceclor CD and Keftab -- from Eli Lilly and Co for $100 million.
--"We project the acquisition will be highly additive to (Dura) earnings beginning in 1997," Ginsberg said.
