Rochester Gas and Electric Corp's 470 megawatt (MW) Ginna 1 nuclear power plant, in Ontario, N.Y., is ramping up power output after tripping off line, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) said Wednesday.  
The company anticipates returning the unit to full power by Thursday morning.
"The unit went back on-line at 5:45 (0545 EDT) this morning. It's at about 30 percent power and holding for chemistry testing," said company spokesman Mike Power.
The unit automatically tripped off line Tuesday afternoon when a feedwater valve failed to close, resulting in low water levels in a steam generator, Power said.
