Insurer Aegon NV said on Thursday it would pay a 1996 interim dividend of 1.18 guilders per share, compared with an interim payment of 0.62 guilders last year.
The increase in the interim dividend is due to the earlier announced change of the method of payment, the company said in a statement.
Aegon now pays half of last year's full-year dividend as an interim. The usual pay-out ratio of 47 percent of net profits will remain unchanged, it added.
