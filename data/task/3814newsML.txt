KIWI International Air Lines said on Tuesday that the Federal Aviation Administration granted approval of the return of the final two aircraft to KIWI's fleet, allowing the airline to operate all of its 15 aircraft.
KIWI voluntarily cut about 25 percent of its flights in late June after an FAA examination revealed problems involving pilot training records at the airline.
