Soon-to-be-floated Thistle Hotels Plc said on Tuesday it was appointing Hartley Sutcliffe finance director and intended to appoint Charles Mackay non-executive deputy chairman.
Mackay will take up his position when the group is admitted on the London Stock Exchange, Thistle -- currently 70 percent owned by New Zealand's Brierley Investments Ltd -- noted in its results statement.  
Sutcliffe joined the Thistle Group as treasurer in 1991.
Earlier, the group reported a first half profit -- before tax and an 87.8 million stg write-down charge -- of 24.1 million stg, 88.3 percent higher than last time.
Thistle said an external valuation of the company's properties had been carried out, valuing the portfolio at 1.69 billion stg. The valuation identified a deficit of 204.6 million stg compared with the values shown in the company's books.
The exceptional item reflected a reduction in value of certain properties below cost, and the balance of 116.8 million stg was deducted from a revaluation reserve, the group said.
