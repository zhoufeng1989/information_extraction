Construction firm Heijmans NV said on Wednesday it had agreed to buy a 50 percent stake in Belgian firms  NV Belgische Asfalt en Betonmaatschappij BAB and  Algemene Centrale Regio Antwerpen NV from NBM-Amstelland NV.
"This makes Heijmans the full owner of both companies," Heijmans said in a statement.  
Heijmans said the two Belgian firms, who posted joint 1995 turnover of 757 million francs, were active in road construction, civil engineering and pipeline construction.
It added the takeover, of which no financial details were disclosed, strengthened its market position in the western part of Belgium. Heijmans was already active in Belgium through its VAG unit in the town of Genk.
