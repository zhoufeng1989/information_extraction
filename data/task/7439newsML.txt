Shares in SEOULBANK, the main creditor to financially-strapped Kun Young Construction Corp, fell in Wednesday morning trading, brokers said.
The shares lost 50 won to a year-low of 5,020 before recovering to 5,040.
On Tuesday Kun Young said it had sought court receivership after defaulting on its debt. SEOULBANK is its major creditor.  
"SEOULBANK is dropping sharply today because of Kun Young," said a Coryo Securities broker.
"But as it nears 5,000 won, which is the share's face value, buying will move in. I don't see any worse impact from the Kun Young news," he added.
Banking shares reported good earnings results in the first half of 1996 and have generally been in favour with investors.
Kun Young defaulted on 1.26 billion won worth of promissory notes on Monday and its stock has been suspended from trading.
A spokesman for SEOULBANK said on Tuesday the bank would not extend further credit to the debt-ridden company. A consortium led by Dongsung Construction has offered to take Kun Young over.
