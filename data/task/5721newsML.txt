Roadway Express Inc said Wednesday it will enact a fuel surcharge, effective September 3, to offset escalating fuel costs.
The surcharge will be based on the U.S. National Average Fuel Index and will remain in effect until further notice, the trucking company said.
"We tried to avoid a surcharge, but the continued fuel increases have surpassed our cost assumptions, thus necessitating this action," said Michael Wickham, president and chief executive of Roadway.
