Golden Knight Resources Inc said its shareholders voted at an extraordinary general meeting yesterday 99 percent in favor of increasing the authorized capital of the company.
It said a special resolution was approved creating 80 million additional common shares without par value, resulting in a total authorized capital of 100 million common shares.
Golden Knight said the increased capitalization will enable the company to proceed with the recently announced acquisition of an additional 12.5 percent of Gold Fields Ghana Ltd and the financing required for the transaction.
