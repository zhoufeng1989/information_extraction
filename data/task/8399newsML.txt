Dutch insurer Aegon NV said on Thursday it had upgraded its expectations regarding the 1996 results.
"Based upon today's exchange rates and barring unforeseen exceptional circumstances, we expect the increase in earnings and earnings per share in guilders for 1996 to be in line with the reported 15.7 percent and 15 percent respectively for the first six months of 1996," Aegon said.
The company said in May it expected 1996 full-year net profits and earnings per share to rise by seven to 12 percent.  
Last year group net profit rose by 14.9 percent to 1.32 billion guilders and earnings per share went up 12.5 percent to 5.04 guilders.
