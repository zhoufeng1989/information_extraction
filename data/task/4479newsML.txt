Shares in UK mobile telephone operator Orange Plc rose on Tuesday after the company reported interim losses broadly in line with expectations.
The company edged two pence higher to 189p by 0714 GMT in pre-market trade, after it posted a first half pre-tax loss of 125.2 million stg.
Analysts forecasts had ranged from 100 million stg to 132 million with a consensus at 124 million. They said on Tuesday that the tone of the statement was confident.  
"It's a good set of figures... some of the fears we've had in the past weren't justified," said ABN Amro Hoare Govett telecommunications analyst James Ross. He identified in particular a fall in the "churn" rate -- how many customers cease using Orange. This decreased to 17.6 percent in the year to June 30 from 18.1 percent in the year to end December.
"They've obviously got a control on that," said Mike Styles of Credit Lyonnais Laing.
There was positive news from monthly revenue per subscriber figures, which rose to 36.86 stg from 36.51 stg year on year.  
Orange managing director Hans Snook said that the company's network covered over 90 percent of the country's population.
"We continue to meet our business plan expectations with strong growth year on year in Orange subscribers and revenues," said Snook in a statement accompanying the results.
Sales in the first half more than doubled to 256.5 million stg from 100 million stg.
