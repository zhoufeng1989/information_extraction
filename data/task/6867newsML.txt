Seer Technologies Inc said Wednesday it had named Thomas Wilson as president and chief executive officer.  
The software company said Wilson was replacing Gene Bedell, a Seer founder who will become a company director.
It said Wilson was president of LiveWorks Inc, a Xerox Corp company, before accepting the offer from Seer.
Seer said it had sold convertible preferred stock to its major shareholder, Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe LP and a number of its affiliates. It said it would use the $12.5 million it earned from the sale for "general corporate purposes".
Seer also said it would restructure its line of credit facility with NationBank, increasing available borrowings to $32.5 million from $20 million and extending the expiration date to September 30, 1997.
