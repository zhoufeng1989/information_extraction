NOTE - Print and packaging firm Clondalkin Group Plc said on Tuesday that it was well placed to maintain progress in all its activities.
Clondalkin said the first-half profit increase reflected organic growth of seven percent due to volume and margin improvements.  
The group said its Irish operations continued to improve with profit growth evenly spread between printing and packaging.
In Britain, profits more than doubled because of the inclusion of the Boxes Group, acquired in September 1995, and because of strong organic growth in the print operations.
Strong profit improvement in the Netherlands counteracted a profit decline in Switzerland where market conditions remain difficult, Clondalkin said. In the U.S., the packaging operations reported the strongest increase.
Clondalkin said it is well balanced in terms of profit mix by currency and exchange rate movements did not materially affect reported earnings per share.
