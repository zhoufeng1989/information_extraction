Shares in Mersey Docks and Harbour Company traded 16 pence lower at 399 pence after the port operator reported a slide in its interim profits, traders said.
"Profits were lower than expected," said one trader.
Mersey Docks said its profits were hit by increased losses from Eurolink, fierce competition on the Irish Sea routes and a 945,000 stg charge from a voluntary severance scheme for Liverpool port employees.  
Mersey Docks said its Eurolink Ferries incurred losses of 4.51 million stg in the period and that it would withdraw from the passenger service by the end of the year.
The shares hit a low of 390 pence earlier and the trader said the shares may recover yet more ground during day after the initial slide.
"They may come back a bit later on," the trader said.
