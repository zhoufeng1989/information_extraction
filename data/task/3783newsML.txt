Grant Geophysical Inc said on Tuesday it had received two seismic data acquisition contracts in South America valued at just under $20 million.
One of the pacts is for work in Venezuela and marks Grant's reentry into this significant seismic acquisition market, said Grant, which provides seismic data to oil and gas companies.
Both contracts will begin in the fourth quarter and extend into the first half of 1997, Grant said.
