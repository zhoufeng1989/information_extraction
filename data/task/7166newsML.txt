The new finance head of Austria's postal and telecommunications service Post und Telekom Austria (PTA) has doubts the 1999 deadline for the privatisation of the company can be met, an Austrian newspaper reported on Wednesday.
"I accept the date put forward by the law as the earliest possible fixture -- but it can only be met under optimal conditions," former Economics Minister Johannes Ditz was quoted as telling the daily Die Presse.
These include a net worth in line with the international norm and a turnaround of the post's highly debt-ridden divisions like its bus service, and letter and parcel delivery.
PTA's postal division posted losses of 4.7 billion schillings last year, while the bus division lost 960 million. -- Vienna newsroom, +431 531 12274
