U.S. safety officials on Wednesday announced that school bus makers Blue Bird Body Co. and Harsco Corp. would recall a total of 11,500 buses that do not meet federal fuel system integrity standards.
National Highway Traffic Safety Administrator Ricardo Martinez said that during crash tests, a 1995 Blue Bird "All American" bus and a 1995 Wayne Co. "Lifestar" bus exceeded the maximum federal allowance fuel leakage.
A NHTSA official said Wayne had since gone pout of business and that Harsco agreed to take responsibility for the recall of the Wayne buses.
The official said that since the NHTSA was not aware of any crashes involving the models in which there was a fuel system fire, the buses should continue to be used until the companies had developed mofifications to remedy the problem.
Martinez emphasised that the risk of fatal injury to children in a school bus was four times less than in a passenger car, making the school bus one of the safest forms of ground transportation.
Once the modifications were developed, the NHTSA said, buses would be repaired at no cost to the owners.
