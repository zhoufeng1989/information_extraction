Salomon Brothers downgraded Jilin Chemical Industrial Co Ltd to underperform, citing higher oil costs and lower profit margins in the second half of 1996.
Jilin management expects its full-year oil costs to rise by 7.5 percent, indicating the second half rise would exceed the 6.9 percent rise recorded in the first six months, Salomon said.
The second-half operating margin was expected to be 11.8 percent versus 13 percent in the first half, analyst Pitzi Lau said in a report.
Salomon forecast net profit for Jilin at 658 million yuan and 691 million yuan for 1996 and 1997 respectively.
