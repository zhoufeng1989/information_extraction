UK telecommunications industry watchdog Oftel said it would be considering British Telecommunications Plc's new pricing structure for ISDN-2 digital communications for business users.
In a statement, Oftel said director general Don Cruickshank would be looking at the new pricing in the light of industry and customer reaction.
"The prices are BT's response to concerns expressed by customers, and reflected in Oftel's (statement last June) that the ISDN-2 connection charge is high compared to other countries," Cruickshank said in a statement.
BT said earlier on Wednesday it would introduce three bands of pricing for its ISDN-2 customers which would cut charges in the first year by between eight percent and 25 percent by altering connection charges and introducing call allowances.
