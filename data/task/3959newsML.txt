Imperial Chemical Industries Plc (ICI) said on Tuesday it had terminated joint venture discussions with the Yu Gang Company of Chongquing, China.
ICI's wholly owned Tioxide Group Limited signed a memorandum of understanding with the Chinese company in December 1995 covering the proposed establishment of a venture to produce titantium dioxide in China.
Tioxide and Yu Gang were, however, unable to reach agreement on the joint venture during their negotiations and mutually agreed not to proceed further, ICI said.
