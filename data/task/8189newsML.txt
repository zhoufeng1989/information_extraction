Royal Bank of Canada said on Thursday it cut its prime lending rate to 5.75 percent from 6.00 percent, effective Friday.
The move follows a bank rate cut of 25 basis points to 4.25 by the Bank of Canada.
Royal Bank's prime rate cut matches an identical move by the Bank of Montreal and the Bank of Nova Scotia.
Canada's major banks last changed their prime lending rates on August 12, when they lowered them to 6.00 percent from 6.25 percent.
The prime rate is the rate charged by banks on loans to their best customers.
