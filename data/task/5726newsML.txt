Seymour Holtzman, the largest individual shareholder of First Financial Corporation of Western Maryland, said on Wednesday that he will withdraw his proposal requesting management to merge or sell the company and will not submit it for shareholder vote at the annual meeting in October.
Holtzman said his decision was a result of his being encouraged by the bank's decision to engage Alex. Brown & Sons to investigate a possible sale or merger.
Holtzman also said that he believes that as the largest individual shareholder, with more than 8 percent of the stock, it is "only fair" that he have representation on the bank's board, "particularly in light of the fact that last year 46 percent of shareholders voted in favor of an independent slate."
The bank announced Tuesday that it had engaged Alex. Brown for advice as it evaluates strategic options, including the possible sale of the company.
