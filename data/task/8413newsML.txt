Dutch financial giant Internationale Nederlanden Groep NV said on Thursday income from financial transactions more than doubled to 534 million guilders in the 1996 first half compared with 208 million a year-ago.
Securities trading was the main reason for this income explosion, rising to 419 million guilders from 79 million, the result of favourable market conditions.
ING said the comparable period in 1995 was especially weak due to the aftermath of the Mexican peso crisis.
Results from the foreign exchange trading portfolio rose to 83 million guilders from 34 million.
Other results from financial transactions fell to 32 million guilders, but the 95 million in the 1995 first half was boosted by the sale of participations, ING said.
In the field of commission income, results rose by 45 percent to 1.29 billion guilders from 888 million.
Securities income rose a fat 83 percent to 378 million guilders, while other commission income also mushroomed by 69 percent to 533 million guilders.
Funds transfer and Insurance broking income remained largely stable at 322 million guilders and 55 million respectively.
