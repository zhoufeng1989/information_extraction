The stock of Rexene Corp. dropped sharply Wednesday, one day after Huntsman Corp. said it was withdrawing its $460 million bid for the Dallas-based chemical firm.
Rexene was off $2.125 at $10.625 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Huntsman, the nation's largest privately held chemical company, announced after the market closed Tuesday that it was calling off its $15 per share offer for Renexe.
Jon Huntsman, chief executive officer and chairman of the family-owned company based in Salt Lake City, said the decision came after Rexene financial adviser Schroder-Wertheim indicated the Rexene board would reject bids substantially above its $15 per share offer.
Huntsman's first bid of $14 per share was rejected by Rexene on July 22. It then sweetened the offer to $15 per share on Aug. 1, but Rexene rejected that bid as well.
Rexene's stock had risen sharply from about $9 per share after Huntsman first launched its bid.
