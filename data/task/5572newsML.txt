Cohesant Technologies Inc said on Wednesday it is too early to estimate the effect a recent fire at a subsidiary's plant may have on the third and fourth quarter earnings.
The company said it expects the third quarter to be a profitable one.
On Aug. 6, a portion of a subsidiary's St. Louis production facility was damaged in a fire. The plant is closed until investigations and capital repairs are completed, the company said.  
The fire, in a section that handles solvent-based materials, injured three employees. During repairs, the company said production of solvent-based adhesives and sealants is outsourced and product deliveries are on schedule.
Production of the company's other adhesives and sealants has not been affected, Cohesant said.
