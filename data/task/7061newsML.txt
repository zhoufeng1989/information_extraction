Duesseldorf Airport said it will invest up to 1.5 million marks on a new rail halt for one of its temporary departure terminals.
Airport authority Flughafen Duesseldorf GmbH (FDG) said in a statement the new S-Bahn local railway halt for Terminal E will go into operation on October 31.
Terminal E is one of two temporary departure terminals which will open on November 1 and will be used for charter airline operations.
More than 30 international carriers, including German charter airline LTU International Airways, will be based there.
The airport's passenger terminal was gutted in a fire on April 11 and flights have since been handled in large tents and former cargo buildings.
From November 1, scheduled airlines are due to transfer to the re-fitted C pier. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel +44 171 542 7706 Fax +44 171 542 5017
