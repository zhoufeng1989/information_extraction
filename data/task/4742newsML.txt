Concessionaire Bangkok Expressway Co Ltd (BECL) said on Tuesday it will set up a wholly-owned unit with three billion baht ($120 million) registered capital to build and operate a new expressway north of the Thai capital.
The unit, Northern Expressway Co Ltd, will have initial capital of 750 million baht ($30 million), BECL said in a filing to the Stock Exchange of Thailand.
BECL won a government concession earlier this year to build and operate the 34-km (21-mile) expressway from Bangkok's northern fringes to the town of Bang Pa-in, the company said.
Total investment in the project will be up to 16 billion baht ($640 million), it said.
Bangkok Expressway will finance the project with its own working capital, by issuing debentures and warrants, and by borrowing from financial institutions, it said.
