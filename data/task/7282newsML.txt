Japan National Railway (JNR) Settlement Corp said on Wednesday that the total number of West Japan Railway Co (JR West) shares that investors applied to buy through a fixed price offer was 7.07 million shares.
Since the number surpassed the 950,000 shares that the corporation had originally planned to sell not via auction, it would decide how to allocate the shares through a lottery, it said.
The fixed price will be settled on August 29, it said.
