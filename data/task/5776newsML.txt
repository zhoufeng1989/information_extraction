Richard Branson, founder and head of the sprawling Virgin Group, is locked in a standoff with local officials in Majorca over his plans to develop a luxury resort there, the Financial Times said.
Branson is seeking to build a 20 million stg complex on a 600 acre site on the island's mountainous northwest coast, with plans to convert a mansion into a 60-room hotel.
The dispute with the local village council is about plans to build 10 houses on the property. The village mayor, Antoni Mora, has said a new building code would allow no new construction in rural areas, the newspaper said.
