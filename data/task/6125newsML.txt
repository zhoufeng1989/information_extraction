Atlantic Richfield Co (ARCO) and Venezuela's Corpoven are seeking an additional partner or partners for a $3.5 billion project to upgrade heavy crude which the two companies signed Wednesday, company officials said.
"We do anticipate taking one or two additional partners into the project," ARCO chairman Mike Bowlin told a news conference in Caracas after signing the deal.
The additional partner will likely provide the outlet for the synthetic 25-degree API crude ARCO expects to upgrade from 9- degree API crude in Venezuela.  
ARCO's refineries in California and Washington State were poorly placed to take the crude, Bowlin said.
"I think it is natural that the market will probably be in the Texas Gulf Coast...but we do think it will be a marketable product and we will look for downstream integration with someone else," he said.
Bowlin refused to comment on which companies had been approached to join the joint venture. Corpoven officials have said that Philipps Petroleum Co was a likely candidate.  
Bowlin insisted that the venture, which will produce 180,000 barrels per day of synthetic crude -- similar to Alaska North Slope -- by 2006, was a first step into penetrating Venezuela's oil industry.
"We hope this will be the first of many new endeavors we will undertake in this country," he said.
ARCO Coal Company President Stephen Mut added that Venezuela "is one of a few countries where ARCO can participate across the whole spectrum of our activities," including coal and petrochemicals.
