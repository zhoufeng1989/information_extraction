Battle Mountain Gold Co said on Thursday it had held preliminary discussions with its 50.4 percent-owned subsidiary Niugini Mining Ltd that might lead to an offer by Battle Mountain for the Niugini shares it does not already own.
Battle Mountain said the talks resulted from a review of strategic alternatives regarding Niugini. No further announcements are anticipated unless and until discussions are completed, it said.
It said it regrets recent inaccurate press statements related to the discussions.  
The statements related to discussions last year regarding a possible combination of Battle Mountain and Mt. Edon Gold Mines (Aust) Ltd, it said.
Those talks were terminated primarily as a result of a 20 percent decline in Battle Mountain's share price during the negotiation period.
No further discussions between Mt. Edon Gold and Battle Mountain Gold are expected, Battle Mountain said.
Niugini holds copper and gold mining interests in Australia, Chile and Papua New Guinea, where it has a 17.2 percent stake in the Lihir gold project.
