Standard & Poor's said on Thursday it had assigned its A minus long-term and A2 short-term local currency issuer credit ratings to CSW Investments.
The rating outlook was stable, S&P said.
"The ratings of SEEBOARD Plc and CSW Investments -- the acquisition holding company -- reflect SEEBOARD's focused and low risk business portfolio, the stability of its customer base, the favorable economic prospects of its region, a supportive regulatory environment, and the company's favorable ownership structure." S&P said.
It said the rating also acknowledged vulnerability associated with a highly leveraged balance sheet and limited flexibility to respond to future developments.
S&P said the stable outlook on the ratings reflected the strength and stability of SEEBOARD's service area and core business, its moderate exposure to non-core activities and the benefit of CSW ownership.
"Whilst revenue growth will be modest in the medium term, successful cost control will be key to maintaining profits at current levels," it said.
SEEBOARD is one of 12 privatized regional electricity companies in England and Wales, and is responsible for electricity distribution and supply in south-east England.
