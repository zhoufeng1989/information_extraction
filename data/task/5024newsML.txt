Music major PolyGram said on Wednesday that it had bought London-based Go!Discs, a pop label whose roster includes top-selling British singer Paul Weller.
PolyGram, one of the world's top five music companies, has acquired the remaining 51 percent of Go!Discs after taking a 49 percent stake in 1987. No financial details were disclosed.
Andy Macdonald, founder and managing director of Go!Discs, is to leave the company.
Set up in 1983, Go!Discs has a reputation for turning raw British pop acts into chart successes at home and abroad.
Besides Weller, now a popular solo singer after leading The Jam and The Style Council in the 1980s, the label's top artists include The Beautiful South, Portishead and Gabrielle.
PolyGram, also a major player in the film industry, is controlled by Dutch electronics giant Philips.
