The research arm of Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, on Thursday said it had lowered its EPS forecasts for the German chemical company Merck KGaA for 1996, 1997 and 1998.  
For 1996 Deutsche MG has downgraded Merck's EPS forecast to 2.27 marks from 2.47 marks, for 1997 to 2.57 marks from 2.87 marks and for 1998 to 3.09 marks from 3.50 marks.
Deutsche MG analysts said the downgrade came in the wake of an analysts' conference call after Merck reported its first-half figures for 1996.
The analysts said they believed Merck would not achieve its forecast profit increase of 30 to 40 percent for the full year and downgraded the share as a result.
Rumours of a downgrade put Merck shares under pressure in early pre-bourse trade. At 0817 GMT Merck shares led the losers on the IBIS DAX index, down 1.10 marks or 1.92 percent at 56.20 marks, compared to the overall market, up 0.31 percent.
