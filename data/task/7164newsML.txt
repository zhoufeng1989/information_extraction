Shares in retailer Promodes cut their losses on Wednesday after the company said it reaffirmed its expectation of a 10 to 15 percent higher 1996 net attributable profit.
The share had earlier been falling on talk of profit downgrades following the August 8 first half sales figures which were seen as disappointing.
Promodes said its first half net profit would be higher despite a decline in operating income.
At 0927 GMT, Promodes was down 1.4 percent at 1,199 after having hit a day-low of 1,171 francs.
