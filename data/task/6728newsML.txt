The U.K. government has approved plans to develop the North Sea Dauntless oil field, operator Amerada Hess Ltd said.
In a statement, Hess said Dauntless along with the nearby Durward field will begin production at the end of the first quarter 1997.
Hess said a "gross plateau production rate" for both fields of more than 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) is planned shortly after startup.
It said the fields will be Hess' "fastest ever stand alone development" and will use a floating production storage and offloading vessels permanently moored over the fields.
Other partners in the fields are Santa Fe Exploration (UK) Ltd, DSM Energy (UK) Ltd, British-Borneo Group and Seafield Resources Plc.
