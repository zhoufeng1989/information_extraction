UK mobile telephone operator Orange Plc, asked to comment on reasons why its share price has fallen below its flotation price, said the extent of continued growth in the British market was not fully understood.
"A lot of people do not understand what this transition process in our marketplace is all about," Orange group managing director Hans Snook said in an interview, referring to concern that growth in the UK market was slowing down.
"In fact, our net growth has increased dramatically...all the key drivers of the business, we are succeeding on," he said.
