Metals firm Metaleurop said on Tuesday it planned to restart lead production at its Nordenham smelter in Germany in early September.
"We are aiming for a restart in early September. That is what is planned and there have been no changes so far," a company spokeswoman told Reuters.
Metaleurop, a subsidiary of Preussag, announced in late July it was closing down the smelter to make technical modifications after some months of experience with its new bath technology.
The smelter started producing lead in March.  
Metaleurop had said output at the new 90,000 tonne plant was to be limited to 70 percent of capacity during the first 12 months of operation.
The spokeswoman said the production target may be adjusted after the restart.
Because of recurring technical problems Nordenham had been producing less lead than initially expected, she said.
Asked if this meant Nordenham would not meet its initial output target for the first 12 months of operation, she said, "We should be below our target but at this stage we cannot say by how much."
Deliveries to customers have not been affected by the closure as Metaleurop was able to secure lead mainly from its Noyelle-Godault plant in France.
Because of a traditional slowdown in orders during the summer, the company did not need to buy extra lead on an already tight physical market, she said.
