P&I clubs are planning a campaign to reduce their reinsurance costs next year from the approximately $330 million paid this year.
"Shipowners cannot tolerate so much money going out on reinsurance. There must be a change," John Lyras, chairman of the London Club, told a news conference called to unveil the club's 1996 annual report.
Protection and indemnity (P&I) clubs are mutual organisations formed by shipowners to insure their vessels. There are 14 clubs worldwide which together are known as the Group.
P&I clubs have already increased the level of self insurance to 15 percent from 10 percent in an effort to inject competition and bring costs down.
Bryan Gaze, deputy chairman and finance director of the London Club's managing agent A Bilborough & Co Ltd, said his personal view was that the cost of reinsurance for P&I clubs could be cut to around $200 million next year.
"The reinsurance market has softened and softened and I anticipate a very significant reduction in premiums for next year...The Group has paid far too much for reinsurance over the past five years," he said.
P&I sources said reinsurers had not lost money on the P&I account over the last ten years, adding that they were planning a sustained campaign over the coming months to bring down their reinsurance costs.
However, some said they considered the target of $200 million was optimistic.
Most P&I reinsurance is placed in the Lloyd's of London market. The P&I initiative to cut their reinsurance bill will add to pressures on marine insurers, who are already concerned about falling rates.
