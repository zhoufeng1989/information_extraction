Italy's Isab has reduced operations at its 220,000 barrels per day (bpd) Sicily refinery because of poor refining margins in the Mediterranean, a company official said on Wednesday.
Output of refined products had been cut back to the minimum required for term contracts, about 80 percent of sales, the official said.
There would be no sales of gasoline, middle distillates or heavy fuel oil on the spot market until at least the middle of next month, the official added.
In an average month Isab sells around 20 percent of its refinery output on the spot market -- around 20,000-40,000 tonnes of gasoline, 25,000-50,000 tonnes of middle distillates and some 50,000 tonnes of high sulphur fuel oil.
It was not immediately clear by what percentage crude runs at Isab had been reduced.
But use of straight-run fuel oil as an alternative feedstock had been boosted, and the refinery was running heavier crudes.
Refining margins have fallen sharply in the past week because the price of crude relative to refined products has risen sharply.
