June freight traffic at Vancouver International Airport was 20 percent higher than June 1995, led by a one-third gain in imports, the airport authority said.
Total freight tonnage, excluding mail, reached 18,487 in June 1996, compared with 15,404 in June 1995, it said.
June import tonnage was 8,458, compared with 6,353 a year earlier, an increase of 33.1 percent.
June exports were 10,029 tonnes, up 10.8 percent.
June also marked the first month of full operations for the airport's new international passenger terminal, built to enhance Vancouver's goal to become a major Pacific Rim gateway.
For the first half of 1996, Vancouver handled 8.4 percent more freight, excluding mail, than in the first half of the preceding year. Total freight tonnage reached 90,778.
Imports led the way, rising 15.5 percent to 41,853 tonnes. Exports rose 2.9 percent to 48,925 tonnes.
New services and increased flights by airlines using Vancouver helped spur freight traffic growth. Air Canada operated four weekly Boeing 747 combi flights to Hong Kong during June, a route it inaugurated last December.
Also, Canadian Airlines International operated new passenger flights to Kuala Lumpur in conjunction with Malaysian Airlines and boosted service to Nagoya and Beijing.
Major U.S. carriers added service to Atlanta, Cincinnati, New York and Miami, while Air Canada and United started service from Vancouver to Los Angeles and San Francisco. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel +44 171 542 8982 Fax +44 171 542 5017
