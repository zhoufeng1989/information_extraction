German steel and engineering group Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp said on Wednesday that U.S. machinery maker Caterpillar Inc planned to buy its MaK Machinenbau subsidiary.
"A final agreement should be concluded in the third quarter of 1996 after approval by the supervisory boards," Krupp said in a statement.
Krupp said the MaK unit, based in Kiel in northern Germany, was one of the world's leading makers of large diesel engines.
