Lands' End Inc said Wednesday it had opened a phone and customer service center in Mettlach, Germany.
It said it had also mailed its first official German-language catalog with prices denominated in marks. The 68-page catalog features a selection of the company's top-selling items of American-styled casual clothing.
Orders will be packed and shipped from the Lands' End European distribution center in Oakham, England.
Lands' End said it tested native-language, local-currency catalogs in France, Germany and the Netherlands in the autumn of 1994 to see which provided the best opportunity for a local operation. For the past year, it said, it has been focused on setting up the German operations and hiring and training local personnel.
Lands' End also operates an international business in Yokohama, Japan, and ships to customers in over 175 countries from its headquarters in Wisconsin.
