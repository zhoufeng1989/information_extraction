American Airlines said on Wednesday it supported USAir Group bid to serve London Heathrow's Airport, saying it was consistent with the "open skies" aviation agreement being discussed by the United States and Britain.  
USAir filed with the U.S. Department of Transportation to serve London's Heathrow Airport from Boston, Charlotte, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.
The carrier cited the need for competition in the U.S.-U.K. market in view of the proposed alliance between British Airways Plc and AMR Corp's American Airlines.
USAir, British Airway's existing trans-Atlantic partner, previously filed a lawsuit against the proposed alliance, alleging the deal would monopolize air travel between the U.S. and Britain and undermine USAir's own agreement with BA.  
BA holds a 24.6 percent stake in USAir.
USAir cannot serve Heathrow until the current Anglo-U.S. aviation treaty is liberalized.
American said it remains optimistic that a new "open skies" agreement will be reached, which will make possible new services such as those proposed by USAir.
American Airlines said it expects some Heathrow slots will be available to U.S. carriers under a the new aviation pact, but there may be costs involved.
In 1991, American said it was required to invest more than $440 million to secure limited access to Heathrow.
"While we agree that additional U.S. carriers should be authorized to serve Heathrow, those who seek to fly there must recognize that realization of their aspirations will inevitably be a function of the costs and practicalities with which we and others have had to contend," said Arnold Grossman, American's vice president of international affairs.
The "open skies" aviation talks are set to resume next week in Washington.
