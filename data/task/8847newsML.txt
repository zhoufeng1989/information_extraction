General Motors Corp said Thursday the suggested price for its OnStar vehicle technology system will be $895 plus dealer installation and a service fee of $22.50 per month.
OnStar is available exclusively on 1997 front-wheel-drive Cadillacs. It added that service fee is guaranteed for the next two years.
The company estimated the daily cost for both the OnStar service and individual cellular phone charges will be under $1.50 or about the equivalent of a gallon of gasoline.
OnStar integrates on-board advanced vehicle electronic architecture with Global Positioning System Satellite technology and a state-of-the-art cellular phone, General Motors said.
Onstar's services include automatic notification of front air bag deployment, emergency service, theft detection and vehicle tracking, remote door unlock, roadside assistance with location and route support.
