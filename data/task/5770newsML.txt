British physicists said on Wednesday they had made a laser out of plastic -- which they said would open up new avenues for using lasers.
They used polyphenylenevinylene (PPV), a plastic known to have luminescent properties, to make the polymer laser.
A plastic laser would have many uses and would be cheaper and easier to make compared to one using crystals or a gas, the team at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge wrote in their report in the science journal Nature.
"It's plastic, it's very easy to handle, it's robust, you can cover large areas," said Nils Tessler, a physicist and engineer who worked on the project.
"You don't need to use very sophisticated machines to make it. You don't need ultra-clean environments."
Lasers work by using photons, the wavelike particles that carry light. If a photon strikes an "excited" particle in a solid, liquid or a gas -- one vibrating at the correct intensity -- that particle will emit another photon travelling in the same direction as the first.
This is called "pumping". A laser will concentrate the energy so it creates a cascade effect -- and a beam of very intense light.
Tessler said the polymer laser -- which he said looked like a clear green or yellow plastic ruler -- had been "pumped" using another laser and had emitted a laser beam.
"You shine in a laser, and then you make a structure with this polymer inside it, and this structure behaves like a laser," he said in a telephone interview. "This is really the beginning."
The next step, he said, would be to use an electrical pump "like plugging it into the wall without needing any other laser light to excite it".
Lasers are used in surgery, to play compact discs, in telecommunications and other areas. Tessler said the new laser could be used for displays, back-lit illuminations and other commercial effects.
