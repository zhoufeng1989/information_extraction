The Hungarian government has decided to offer an 89 percent stake in Magyar Hitel Bank Rt to strategic investors, and intends to complete the sale by the end of the year, a government official said on Thursday.
"A tender will be announced in the first days of September and the government expects the sale to be finalised by the end of the year," government spokesman Elemer Kiss told a news conference following Thursday's regular cabinet meeting.  
Kiss also said that the successful bidder will have to raise the bank's capital, but could not give any figure.
The buyer will also have to maintain and develop the bank's universal business policy, Kiss said.
Magyar Hitel Bank Rt has a registered capital of 13.1 billion forints, he said.
A further five percent stake in the bank will be offered to the bank's employees and management.
