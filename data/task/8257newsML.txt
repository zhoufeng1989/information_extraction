LOS ANGELES, Calif, Aug 22 (Reuter) Programming venture Americast said Thursday it had signed a $1 billion contract with Zenith Electronics Corp to buy at least three million digital set-top boxes for its home entertainment service.  
Americast, a consortium among Ameritech Corp, South Corp, GTE Corp, SBC Communications and The Walt Disney Co, said the non-exclusive contract was part of its strategy to develop and market the next generation in home entertainment.
Production of the boxes was to begin during the first half of 1997, it added.
Americast cited Zenith as saying the boxes would allow the consortium to deploy four kinds of video networks: "wireless cable" (MMDS), hybrid fiber-coax, switched digital video (fiber to the curb) and direct broadcast satellite.
Americast said Southern New England Telecommunications Corp had signed a letter of intent under which it would join the consortium as a partner.
