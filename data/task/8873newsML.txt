Brown-Forman Corp said Thursday that first quarter growth in its wines and spirits brands was offset by lower earnings from the consumer durables unit and lower sales of Tropical Freezes.
The company said earnings growth for the rest of fiscal 1997 is expected to accelerate.
In the first quarter ended July 31, Brown-Forman earned $32.4 million or $0.47 per share on net sales of $424 , compared to $32.2 million, or $.46 per share last year.  
Brown-Forman said its wines and spirits segment revenues increased nine percent for the quarter, led by worldwide sales gains for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. First quarter results were also aided by sales gains for premium wine brands.
Revenues from the consumer durables segment declined 11 percent for the quarter, due to lower sales at Lenox Collections, the company's direct marketing division, the company said.
Despite this quarter's results, Lenox is expected to show full year improvement over its fiscal 1996 results, the company said.
