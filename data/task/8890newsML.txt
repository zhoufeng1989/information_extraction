Shoe Carnival Inc said gross profit margins improved to 27.7 percent in the second quarter, compared to 26.8 percent in the year-ago quarter.
"Just as we saw in the first quarter, the increase in net earnings for the second quarter was driven by the improvement in gross profit margins, which confirms our strategy of lowering inventory levels," said chairman Wayne Weaver.
The shoe retailer reported on Thursday that net income increased to $891,000 or $0.07 per share in the quarter ended August 3, from $625,000 or $0.05 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 1995.
Net sales for the second quarter increased four percent to $57.6 million from last year's $55.5 million, it said.
"We enter the second half of the year with per-store inventories 18 percent lower than a year ago and we feel the content of the inventory is much better than last year," Weaver said. "A fresher and more focused product offering, particularly in the athletic category, combined with a more effective advertising campaign has resulted in a positive comparable store sales trend thus far in August."
