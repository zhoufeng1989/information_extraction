Lyonnaise des Eaux said that it had won, in association with Turkey's BTP Enka, Turkey's first international tender for running a water distribution and purification service.
Lyonnaise des Eaux and Enka won a 10-year contract to run the water service of Antalya, with 530,000 inhabitants, over competition by Saur, North West Engineering and Thames Water.
Lyonnaise said the water service would have sales in the first year of $7.0 million.
It did not detail the investment needed but said the project fell within a bigger World Bank and European Investment Bank investment project.
