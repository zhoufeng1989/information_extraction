After tax profit's at Nigerian conglomerate SCOA fell to 64.8 million naira for the first six months of 1996 from 71.7 million naira in 1995, the company said on Wednesday.
A company statement said the drop in profit was due to very low profit margins on a substantial proportion of turnover and high operational costs.
Turnover rose to 3.1 billion naira from 1.3 billion naira in the first six months of 1995.
"It is hoped that the prevailing stability in the value of the naira and the downward trend in interest rates and inflation will influence positively the demand for goods and services in the second half of the year," the company said.
Pre-tax profits were 92.5 million naira in 1996 against 113.8 million naira in 1995. Taxation fell to 27.7 million naira from 42.1 million naira the previous year.
SCOA shares closed unchanged in Wednesday trading on the Nigerian stock exchange.
