Brite Voice Systems Inc said it had won a $7 million contract to support a marketing campaign by Britain's Cellnet relaunch Callback, its intelligent messaging service.
Cellnet, a mobile telephone network jointly owned by British Telecommunications Plc and Securicor Group Plc, has purchased four additional Voice Services Director platforms for Callback. It is the largest single order ever for Brite.
Brite said the latest order represented another significant Cellnet investment in Brite's systems, for a total commitment of about $18.6 million during the past two years.
