-- "We now estimate earnings per ADR of $1.05 for 1996 and $1.27 for 1997," it said, adding that its previous estimates were of $1.16 for 1996 and $1.34 for 1997.
-- Klabin reported earnings per ADR of $0.16 in the second quarter.
-- Klabin preferred and common shares were not traded this morning on the Sao Paulo bourse.
