Financial services group Internationale Nederlanden Groep NV (ING) said on Thursday it expected the profit growth rate posted in the second quarter of this year to continue in the second half of 1996.
"We think the growth we have shown in the second quarter can be extended to the third quarter and the fourth quarter," chairman of the executive board Aad Jacobs told a news conference.  
Earlier on Thursday ING said its 1996 first-half net profit had risen by 28 percent to 1.51 billion guilders. This was the balance of a 42 percent surge in the first quarter and a 17.2 percent rise in the second quarter profit.
Jacobs said that the second quarter growth rate was more normal than the 28 percent shown for the full first-half of the current year.
ING earlier said it expected profit growth in the rest of this year to slow from the first half rate. Jacobs said this was because the results of last year's first quarter were quite depressed as a result of the Mexican peso crisis.
