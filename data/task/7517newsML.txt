German food retail group AVA Allgemeine Handeslgesellschaft der Verbraucher AG said on Wednesday it does not expect consumption in Germany to increase during the rest of 1996.
AVA said there was no sign of any significant turnaround in consumption patterns for 1997 either.
The group said it had seen no evidence of any improvement for the retail industry in the first half of 1996.
AVA quoted statistics from the German retail industry association, which showed a one percent drop in retail sales in the first half of 1996 compared to the same period in 1995.
AVA said that the research group Nielsen had estimated a 4.6 percent fall in retail grocery trade in the first half of 1996 compared to the first six months of 1995.
New longer shop opening hours in Germany, which are due in November, would not lead to a real increase in consumption, and were more likely to lead to sales being spread around the group's different divisions, AVA said.
