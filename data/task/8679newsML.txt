-- Local investment bank Banco Patrimonio, an associate of Salomon Brothers, said it cut its rating on Brazilian retailer Lojas Americanas to hold from buy.
-- Patrimonio cited the slow pace of implementing new MIS technology and logistics, which would allow Lojas Americanas to reap high-efficiency gains.
-- "Thus, we believe the bulk of the cost savings will be realized in 1998-99," it said in a report.  
-- On the bright side, Lojas Americana's partner, U.S.-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc, is likely to overcome its problems in Brazil and post a profit in 1997 as it adds more stores to its base, the investment bank said.
-- The bank said Wal-Mart's 1996 results are likely to be hurt by still undiluted fixed costs and opening expenses.
-- Lojas Americanas preferred was down 0.10 at 15.80 reais while its voting common was off one real at 15.50 reais at 1420 local/1720 GMT on the Sao Paulo stock exchange.
