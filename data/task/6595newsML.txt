Indian engineering major Larsen & Toubro (L&T) is planning a 5-billion rupee issue of bonds to part-finance a cement project and its normal capital expenditure, company officials said on Wednesday.
L&T is one of India's leading engineering and construction firms with sales of 42.47 billion rupees and a net profit of 3.89 billion rupees for the year ended March 31, 1996.
The company is planning to set up a 1.75 million tonne per annum cement plant in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.
The issue comprises four different types of bonds, including bonds which offer returns payable half-yearly or yearly and deep-discount bonds which offer lump-sum payments at the end of a pre-determined period.
The bonds have been given the highest possible rating of AAA by the Credit Rating Information Services of India Ltd, an L&T statement said. The issue is expected to open in September.
