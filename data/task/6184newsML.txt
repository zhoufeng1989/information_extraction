Moody's Investors Service said on Wednesday the New Zealand government was likely to receive a special dividend in 1996 from its Electricity Corp of New Zealand (ECNZ) due to an expected positive asset revaluation.  
"The government will likely receive (a) future special dividend from the expected positive revaluation of ECNZ's assets in 1996," Moody's said.
It also said it was concerned by the New Zealand government's continued aggressive financial management of ECNZ and the high dividend payout ratios it was forcing ECNZ to pay.
It said this policy could prevent equity growth and will result in the maintenance of low retained cash flow relative to total debt. Moody's made the comment in a statement confirming ECNZ's long term debt rating at Aa3 after a ratings review.  
"The (high dividend payout) policy could also allow the payment of cash dividends from the proceeds of debt which has been raised on the basis of a positive revaluation of ECNZ's assets," Moody's said.
