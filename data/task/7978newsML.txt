HSBC Holdings will search for more acquisition opportunities after the $620 million purchase of a U.S. savings and loan bank by its U.S. arm Marine Midland but analysts said on Thursday it was in no hurry.
"Marine Midland has turned down an awful lot more than it has bid for," said Ian McEwen, banking analyst at Lehman Brothers, adding it would like to be a bigger player in the U.S.
HSBC said on Thursday that its Marine Midland unit had bought First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Rochester, New York, as part of its strategy to widen its retail base.
Analysts said the $620 million price was sizeable.  
"$620 million is a lot, but not to them," said John Tyce, banking analyst at Societe General Strauss Turnbull.
He saw "local synergies" between the two operations as First Federal is based in Rochester, in the north eastern U.S., as is Marine Midland.
McEwen said the deal fitted with Marine Midland's aims.
"The strategy, which is to in-fill that Marine Midland franchise in the north-eastern U.S. and extend along the sea-board, makes sense," said McEwen.
Acqusitions in the U.S. can appear expensive because the purchaser must pay a premium to book value of around 2.5 times.
But analysts said the buyer is usually able to elimate costs very quickly.
Tyce pointed to the opportunities to cut costs but said the asking price of potential bid targets may mean HSBC would hold off from making any big strategic moves.
