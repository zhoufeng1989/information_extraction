Shares of Yaohan International Holdings Ltd (YIH) surged on Tuesday after the company announced plans to privatise its 41.95 percent-owned department store operator Yaohan Hongkong Corp Ltd.
"Market makers were seen boosting the price to encourage shareholders in the department store firm to exchange their shares for YIH shares," said a sales manager at a local brokerage.
The shares rose HK$0.14 or 18.18 percent to hit a morning high of HK$0.91 before fixing at HK$0.90 at midday. Volume was 582,000 shares.
Analysts said expectations that privatisation of the loss-making unit would help relieve YIH's financial burden aided demand.
YIH has offered 451 new YIH shares for every 1,000 Yaohan Hongkong shares or a cash payment of HK$0.381 per share.
