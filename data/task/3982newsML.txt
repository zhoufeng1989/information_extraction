Thistle Hotels strong underlying profit growth and trading performance was welcomed as the ideal springboard for its forthcoming London flotation and share offer plans, said analysts on Tuesday.
Thistle reported a near-doubling of pretax and pre-exceptional profits to 24.1 million stg. Alex Kyriakidis, analyst at consultant Arthur Andersen said the results, which showed strong growth in London and lesser growth in other regions, would "keep the market interested."  
He added that the 10 percent cut in the valuation for the hotel portfolio to 1.7 billion stg was also to be welcomed, despite resulting in a 87.8 million stg exceptional charge against profits and a 116.8 million deduction in the revaluation reserve.
"Thistle is using this opportunity (the float) to clean up its house and it's given the right signal to investors," said Kyriakidis.
Thistle chief executive Robert Peel had told Reuters earlier that the downward revision was in line with the rest of the sector and mainly hit hotels outside London.
