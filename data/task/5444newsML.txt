Hungarian carpet factory Sotex Rt, member of the home improvement product group Graboplast, said it expected a stronger second half.
"The second year half is traditionally stronger for Sotex Rt," Sotex said in a statement on Wednesday. "That's why the 800 million forint turnover, forecast for the second half of the year, certainly looks achievable."
Sotex based its turnover forecast on increased orders.
In the first six months of 1995 Sotex generated sales revenue of 640 million forints, 40 percent higher than in the corresponding period of 1995.
Graboplast's consolidated first half figures, released on August 13, showed an operating profit of 719.9 million forints on net sales of 6.89 billion.
On the Budapest Stock Exchange Graboplast closed at 3,550 forints, up 50.
