South Korea's Soosan Heavy Industries Co Ltd said on Wednesday it would offer a 1-for-4 rights issue in October to raise operating funds and facilities investment.
The issue will increase paid-in capital to 25.7 billion won from 19.7 billion at present.
A Soosan Heavy statement said the company plans to issue 1.2 million new common shares, of which 20 percent would be offered to its employees. The rest will be allocated to shareholders registered as of September 30 for rights.
The issue price will be set at a 25 percent discount to the base price, which will be decided later.
Subscription is scheduled for October 28 and 29, with payment due by November 1.
