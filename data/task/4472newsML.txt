Shares in construction group Costain Plc fell on Tuesday after a newspaper reported it was in breach of stock exchange listing requirements.
The stock was four pence lower at 67p by 0807 GMT.
The Times newspaper said Costain was in talks with the stock exchange because three of its shareholders hold more than 75 percent of its equity capital.
The problem has come about as a result of Costain's 74 million stg rescue package, The Times said, which left new Malaysian investor Intria with 40 percent of the shares.
Another shareholder, Kuwait's M A Kharafi & Sons, has meanwhile upped its holding to 25.2 percent of the shares.
"They've overclubbed it slightly," said one marketmaker.
