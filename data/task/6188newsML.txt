Fletcher Challenge Forest Division rose eight cents to $1.94 in early Thursday trading after a briefing on Wednesday evening on its 37.5 percent purchase of Forestry Corp of New Zealand.
Brokers said the company had spelt out the logic of marrying FCNZ with Fletcher Forest and that had gone down well.
"The fact that there is no cash issue is a relief for shareholders," Cavill White's Don Turkington said.  
Fletcher said it would sell some of its other forests to fund the purchase. Brokers said the leverage of the consortium buying FCNZ, in which China's Citic also holds 37.5 percent and Brierley Investments 25 percent, was higher than previously expected.
Fletcher Forests' rise was against a background of a firm market.
It is also considered a stock sensitive to bond yields and they have been rallying lately, brokers said.
Volume was 417,843 after 20 minutes.
