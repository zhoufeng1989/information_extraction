Shares in Philip Morris Cos Inc continued to fall preceding Thursday's U.S. market open, deepening a rout that began yesterday on expected tougher federal regulations and new cigarette-related lawsuits.
Philip Morris shares traded at 87 before the regular-session start, off 5/8, traders said.
They reported no moves in other tobacco issues in early pre-open activity, including RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp, Brooke Group Ltd and UST Inc.
