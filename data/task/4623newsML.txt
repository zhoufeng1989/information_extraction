Pesaka Jardine Fleming head of research Dominic Armstrong said the firm on Tuesday upgraded its rating on Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) to buy from sell based on its stock valuation and growth prospects.
"We're very bullish," Armstrong said. "We've been sellers of Maybank for 18 months. It was a sell and now it's a buy."
Earlier today, Maybank reported a 24 percent rise in net profit to 1.07 billion ringgit for the year ended June 30, 1996 from 863.53 million ringgit.
