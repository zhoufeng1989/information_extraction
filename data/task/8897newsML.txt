Deutsche Morgan Grenfell/C.L. Lawrence (corrects from J.C. Bradford) initiated coverage of six semiconductor related companies with accumulate and hold ratings.
Analyst Kathryn Buergert said she started Brooks Automation Inc and Tencor Instruments with accumulate and Electroglas Inc with hold.
She said the rating were based on the companies' earnings per share outlook. Brooks EPS are expected to climb to $1.15 in fiscal year 1997 from $1.07 in 1996. Tencor is expected to climb to $1.70 from $1.13 while Electroglas is expected to fall to $0.85 from $1.63.  
Analyst Elliott Rogers said he initiated coverage of DuPont Photomasks Inc and Semitool Inc with accumulate and LTX Corp with hold.
"The accumulate ratings reflect some uncertainty about the near-term outlook as far as capital spending is concerned," Rogers said.
"The hold rating on LTX reflects these same concerns but exacerbated by a customer -- Korea's Daewoo Corp -- which claims an order worth $50 million was never placed."
