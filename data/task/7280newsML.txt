State-owned PNOC-Exploration Corp (PNOC-EC) has started drilling a third onshore well at the Maniguin prospect on the central Philippine island of Mindoro, the Department of Energy (DOE) said on Wednesday.
The estimated recoverable reserves from Maniguin are 18.7 to 37.4 million barrels of oil, the department said.
