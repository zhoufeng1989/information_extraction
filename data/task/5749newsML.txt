Pilgrim's Pride Corp said Wednesday its annual sales have surpassed $1 billion for the first time in a fiscal year.
The mark was hit with seven weeks remaining in its fiscal year, which ends September 28, company Chairman and Chief Executive Lonnie Pilgrim said.
Pilgrim's Pride, a 50-year-old chicken producer, came close to the $1 billion mark last year, when it reached $931.8 million in sales, the company said.
