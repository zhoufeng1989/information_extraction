The Freight Connection Inc said Tuesday its net income for the past six months was down to $115,797 from $144,847 for the same period last year.
Revenues for the six-month period, which ended June 30, were $10.244 million, up $1.060 million for the same period in 1995.
Company president Michael Jackson said the net income reflects the start-up costs associated with opening a new office in Atlanta.
But, he said in a statement, the new office already has brought in new business.
