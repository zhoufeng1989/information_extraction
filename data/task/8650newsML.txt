Dominion Bond Rating Service said on Thursday it confirmed all the ratings of CT Financial Services Inc including its convertible debentures at AA (low) with a stable trend, after its deal to sell a U.S. unit.
CT Financial's ratings will remain at Pfd-1 for its senior preference shares, Pfd-1 (low) for its non-cumulative preference shares and R-1 (middle) for its short-term debt instruments.
CT Financial sold its First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Rochester to Marine Midland Bank of Buffalo, which is owned by HSBC Holdings Plc.  
DBRS said the C$935 million price is "favorable." Also, CT Financial's decision to enter the U.S. market in another fashion will not likely affect its bottom line. DBRS said "... key capital ratios will remain favorable under any scenario." CT Financial is 98 percent owned by Imasco Ltd, which is 41.5 percent owned by B.A.T Industries Plc.
