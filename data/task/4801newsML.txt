Yaohan International Holdings Ltd said on Tuesday it plans to privatise its loss making 41.95 percent held Hong Kong and Macau department store unit, Yaohan Hongkong Corp Ltd.
Parent Yaohan International said it planned to issue 451 new Yaohan International shares for every 1,000 Yaohan Hongkong shares held by minority shareholders or minority shareholders could take a cash entitlement of HK$0.381 for every Yaohan Hongkong share.  
Shares of Yaohan Hongkong, which operates 10 department stores in Hong Kong and Macau, fell three cents to HK$0.34 in early Tuesday trade. Yaohan International rose 10 cents to HK$0.87, after slipping nine cents to HK$0.77 on Monday.
Yaohan International said it would issue a maximum of 94.25 millon new shares, representing 9.53 percent of the existing issued share capital of the company in the privatisation scheme.
Yaohan Hongkong posted a HK$165.47 million loss for the year ended March 31, 1996 against a HK$46.87 million loss in 1995.  
Yaohan Hongkong said the loss in 1995/96 was partly caused by a significant increase in rentals for its Shantin store and depreciaton charges related to the new Ma On Shan store.
The proposal was conditional on approvals by shareholders of Yaohan Hongkong and the related authorities.
The company expects the scheme to become effective around the end of October.
