Brooks Fiber Properties Inc said Thursday it would invest more than $60 million to build and operate three fiber optic networks in the White Plains, N.Y., San Mateo, Calif., and Springfield, Mo., areas.
The networks will operate under the name of Brooks Fiber Communications, competing with services offered by NYNEX Corp, Pacific Telesis Group's Pacific Bell and SBC Communications Inc's Southwestern Bell.
With the three new systems, Brooks Fiber will have 29 U.S. networks in operation or under construction.
Brooks Fiber plans to be in 30 markets by the end of 1996 and at least 50 by the end of 1998.
Construction of the networks will begin immediately, with services expected to be offered in the first quarter of 1997.
