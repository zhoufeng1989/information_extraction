Television Asia is a monthly magazine for broadcasters throughout Asia. Cahners also received a 1997 option to buy Partners in Media's Asia Image, a publication covering Asia's production and post-production markets.
The unit will become part of Cahners' Publishing Group. Cahners is a division of Reed Elsevier.
