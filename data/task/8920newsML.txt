NEW YORK, August 22 (LPC) - Bank of New York, Chase Manhattan Bank, Citicorp's Citibank and Toronto-Dominion Bank are arranging a $600 million loan for LIN Television Corp, market sources said.
The deal refinances a $500 million loan put in place by the four banks in November 1994, according to bankers.
Pricing on the 8.25-year reducing revolver ranges from 40 to 100 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), depending on the borrower's leverage ratio, a banker said. The four lead banks are soliciting existing lenders to join the new deal, bankers said.
The 1994 loan was structured as a $300 million, eight-year revolver and a $200 million, eight-year revolver with opening pricing op 200 basis points over LIBOR, a banker said.
