The stock of Khong Guan Holdings Malaysia Bhd will be suspended on Wednesday at the company's request, an official at the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) said.
Officials at the diversified firm whose businesses include biscuit-making could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday.  
Shares of the company jumped 32 percent to 18.80 ringgit on Tuesday.
Khong Guan's chief executive officer Patric Lim was quoted in The Star newspaper on Wednesday as saying he did not know why the stock was surging.
But Lim said the company was hoping to ink a "multi-million ringgit" deal involving an infrastructure project, the article reported. However, he declined to provide further details or to link it to the stock price gains, the article said.
