Kulicke & Soffa Industries Inc said Wednesday it expects to incur a $8 million fourth quarter charge for costs associated with its "re-sizing" efforts.
The charge for the fourth quarter ended September 30 includes severance payments for laid-off workers, inventory write-downs and asset write-offs, the company said.
"In response to current industry conditions, the company has decided to re-size its operations to meet anticipated demand in the near term," chairman, C. Scott Kulicke said.  
The company, which supplies semiconductor assembly equipment, lay certain research and development projects and product launches.
The firm said it will also reduce capital spending plans, cut management compensation for fiscal year 1997 and delay wage increases until it returns to profitability.
"We continue to believe that the fundamental factors affecting demand for semiconductors, and consequently semiconductor assembly equipment, remain favorable over the longer term," Kulicke said.
"Price reductions in integrated circuits should ultimately lead to increased demand for semiconductor devices and create a need for more assembly capacity than exists today," he said.
