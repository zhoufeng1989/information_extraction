British pest control to security group Rentokil Group Plc said on Thursday that it plans no major disposals from its acquired rival BET.
Earlier this year Rentokil won a fierce battle to buy BET for 2.1 billion stg and said that it would consider the future of BET's Plant Hire, Style and Resorts International unit.
But chief executive Clive Thompson told Reuters the firm had examined the whole group and now planned no major sales, though there might be some minor disposals.
"We have looked at those businesses and we believe that we can help them to grow and improve," he said.
