Lyons Irish Holdings repeated on Wednesday its rejection of an offer by Anglo-Dutch consumer products group Unilever Plc/NV for the shares Unilever does not already own in Lyons.
Lyons said in a statement that it was surprised that Unilever did not appear to take account of the negative response to Unilever Ireland's original offer.
Unilever earlier said it was extending its offer period for the minority shareholding it does not already own in Lyons "until further notice". Unilever acquired a 75 percent stake in the company from Allied Domecq Plc in February.
Last week the Lyons Irish board rejected Unilever's 323.3 Irish pence offer to mop up the remaining 25 percent stake as "inadequate".
Lyons repeated its advice to its shareholders to reject the Unilever offer.
