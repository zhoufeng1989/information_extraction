Shares in German steel and machinery group Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp dropped on Wednesday after the company warned that the second half of 1996 would be more difficult than expected.
Dealers said the forecast, made in Krupp's interim report, was interpreted by the market as a profit warning.
The stock had dropped 2.7 percent to 214 marks by 0921 GMT, making it among the three biggest decliners, while the blue-chip DAX index was down 0.6 percent at 2,545.11 points.
However one dealer predicted that the effect would be short-lived as the difficulties the company faces, especially in the steel sector, were already well known.
Dealers also attributed a small sell-off in steelmaker Thyssen AG during the pre-bourse session to Krupp's warning.
Thyssen shares were down one mark at 262.50 in bourse trade, more or less in line with the overall market, after falling to a low of 260 in the early electronic trading session.
