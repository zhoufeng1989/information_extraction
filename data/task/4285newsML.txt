Environmental Safeguards Inc said late Monday that recent Rule 144 notices of sales of the company's stock did not concern insider selling.  
James Percell, Chairman, President and Chief Executive of the company, said in a statement, "There is a vast misconception by both brokers and investors concerning recent wire information regarding Rule 144 notices to sell EVSF common stock. These notices are not from insiders, but from those shareholders that have owned restricted stock for the necessary holding period of two years or more. Some of the shareholders filing 144 notices are former directors and officers of Environmental Safeguards, but no longer are associated with EVSF in this capacity. Historically, the vast majority of shares of common stock issued by the company have been restricted and therefore it is necessary for shareholders owning restricted shares for less than three years to file a Rule 144 notice with the SEC regarding intended sales of these shares. It is very important that the investing community understand that these 144 notices are not related to insider selling."
Environmental Safeguards is a recycler and remediator of hydrocarbon and hydrocarbon derivative contaminated soil.
