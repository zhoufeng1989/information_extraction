Investors who bought into the Commonwealth Bank of Australia last month, through the government sell down of its remaining stake, are riding high on the bank's stronger than expected dividend announcement.
At 3.25 p.m. (0525 GMT), Commonwealth installment receipts were 33 cents at A$7.26. This is a 21 percent rise on the initial A$6.00 price paid by investor last month, when the government sold off its 50.4 percent stake.  
Commonwealth Bank reported a 13.8 percent rise in net profit to A$1.119 billion in the year to June 30, 1996 and declared a final dividned of 52 cents a share, compared with 46 cents a year ago, making a total of 90 cents, compared with 82 cents.
"It's the dividend, that was much stronger than expected," said one Sydney-based banking analyst.
The bank's results were at the upper end of expectations and helped push the Commonwealth Bank's ordinary share price up 29 cents or 2.62 percent to A$11.34, its highest level since February 23, 1996, by 0530 GMT on Wednesday.
