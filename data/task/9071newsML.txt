Leisure group Servgro International said on Thursday it was considering listing subsidiary Forbes Financial Services Group.
It said that although an in principle decision had been taken on listing Forbes, in which it has a 70 percent stake, no firm decision had yet been taken on the timing or the details.
Forbes operates a number of specialist businesses which include risk management, actuarial, employee benefit and insurance companies.
The company lifted attributable profit by 31 percent to 55 million rand in the 1996 financial year and further growth was anticipated from its divisions.
"Various alternatives to achieve the listing are being considered and when the final decisions have been accepted by the boards of both Servgro and Forbes, a more detailed announcement will be made," it said.
