Gruntal & Co has moved to distance itself from an essay on airline safety written by its airline analyst Steve Lewins.
"This was not authorized or approved by Gruntal, nor does Gruntal endorse the opinions and statements expressed by Mr Lewins," Randy Bradley, Gruntal senior vice president and executive assistant to the chairman, said in a brief statement dated August 21.
Lewins told Reuters the essay dealt with airline safety and offered recommendations for improved safety and security in the skies.  
The essay was not immediately available to Reuters.
Lewins declined to give details about the essay but said it was a personal assessment and was not related to his role as Gruntal's airline analyst.
Lewins also said he agreed "wholeheartedly" with Gruntal's statement and, in fact, had suggested it be written.
Bradley's statement said Gruntal has begun an investigation "and will take all appropriate actions." Bradley said Lewins continued to be employed by Gruntal, adding only, "We are reviewing the situation."
He declined to elaborate.
