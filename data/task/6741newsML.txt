Britain will detail the terms of the award of a second large suburban railway franchise to French utility group Cie Generale des Eaux later on Wednesday, the government's Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (OPRAF) said.
OPRAF said in a statement details of the award of one of London's regional train companies, South Eastern, would be announced at 1000 GMT by franchising director Roger Salmon.
OPRAF has already awarded Generale des Eaux subsidiary CGEA the South Central franchise, which operates services adjoining the South Eastern region and uses some of the same stations.
Last week OPRAF named CGEA and its railway operating unit London & South Coast Ltd, as the preferred bidder for the South Eastern franchise.
The train operating company, which employs more than 4,000 staff and had passenger revenues of 215 million stg in 1994/95, will be the ninth of 25 such firms to be franchised under the Conservative government's rail privatisation plan.
Franchises have so far been awarded for a range of periods from seven years upwards, with some of the longer contracts also involving bidders in commitments to replace old rolling stock.
