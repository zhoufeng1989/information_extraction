The 2.4 million barrel per day (bpd) Sumed pipeline was operating normally after a brief disruption earlier on Thursday, port agents in Egypt said.
There was a queue of ships at both the Ain Suhkna discharge port and the Sidi Kreir loading ports but tankers were loading and discharging normally, the agents said.
"There was a breakdown but there was not anything serious. The pipeline is operating normally now. There are lines of ships only because of the shutdown," one agent said.
The Sumed carries crude oil from Saudi Arabia, Iran and Kuwait to the Mediterranean port of Sidi Kreir.
