The Australian Stock Exchange said the shares of satellite pay televsion group Australis Media Ltd would be suspended from trading at the request of the company, pending an annoucement on the group's long term financing.  
On Monday, Australis requested a trading halt to its shares as talks continued on fresh long term funding of Australia's first pay TV operator. Analysts have said Australis could be forced into liquidation if the group does not get more funding.
The negotiations between the company and a swag of investors were focussed on the demand by bondholders for an equity injection of up to A$100 million.
The bondholders, who backed a US$175 million issue last year, are seeking the equity injection before they will approve a further debt raising of US$225 million.
