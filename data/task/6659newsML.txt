U.K. oil production averaged 2.51 million barrels per day (bpd) in July, up from 2.45 million in June and the highest level since March, the Aberdeeen Petroleum Report said on Wednesday.
The newsletter said summer maintenance work had a "minimum effect" and was offset by higher output at several smaller fields.
Output was also boosted by the first full month of production from the Andrew field which averaged 16,402 bpd in July after starting up in June.
