-- CS First Boston analyst Michael Hoffman said he initiated coverage of American Disposal Services Inc with a buy rating, saying it was one of the least expensive stocks in the industry.
"It has the lowest valuation, great growth prospects and a great management team. It has an asset base that should sustain growth in the mid to upper-twenties over the next three to five years," Hoffman said.
