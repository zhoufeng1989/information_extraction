Taiwan's state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp said on Wednesday it would reject two Japanese oil refiners' offers to renew crude oil processing deals that expired in February.
"The two Japanese refiners' equipment is not prepared (unable) to produce the 0.5 percent sulphur fuel oil that Taiwan's environmental rules require," Chinese Petroleum vice president Chang Hung-chiang said.
Chinese Petroleum's term-processing deals with Japan's Nansei Sekiyu KK and Okinawa Sekiyu Seisei Co Ltd, which expired in February, had run for more than two years, providing Chinese Petroleum with one percent sulphur content fuel oil.
Chang said cost was a key consideration in the decision not to renew the deals.  
"In many cases, it is cheaper to buy what we need on the market than through a refining process contract," he said.
The previous processing fee per barrel between Nansei Sekiyo and Chinese Petroleum was between $2.0 and $2.50, Japanese oil industry sources said.
Chinese Petroleum would reconsider the agreements in 1997 if the Japanese refiners improve their equipment and reduce their prices, he added.
Taiwan and South Korea have often turned to refiners in Okinawa, Japan's southernmost island, because their geographical proximity helps cut shipping costs.
