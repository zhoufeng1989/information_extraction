Pharmacyclics Inc said on Thursday that it has withdrawn its registration for a secondary public offering of two million shares of common stock.
"We are not willing to raise equity capital at the current valuation, especially with the continued progress in our cancer treatment trials with both Gd-Tex, a radiation sensitizer and Lu-Tex, a photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy," said Richard Miller, president and chief executive officer, in a press release.
Yesterday, Pharmacyclics reported a loss for the fourth quarter ended June 30, 1996 of $2.8 million, compared to a loss of $2.7 million the previous fourth quarter.
