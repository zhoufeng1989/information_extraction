Petrofina's 85,000 barrels per day Rome refinery has cut back its operations by around 10 percent because of poor refining margins in the Mediterranean, a source familiar with the refinery's operations said.
The refinery would run at 90 percent of usual capacity, instead of its normal 100 per cent, for "at least the next week," the source said.
Output of oil products would be trimmed as a result but it was not known if the refinery would be buying more straight-run fuel oil as an alternative feedstock to crude.
The refinery is operated by Petrofina, while Monte Shell and Isab are also shareholders.
