Leading European cartonboard manufacturer Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG (MMK) said on Tuesday it had bought a 70 percent stake in folding carton producer Solnice Papirny S.P. of the Czech Republic.
Deputy chief executive Alfred Fogarassy said MMK is poised to announce further acquisitions of production sites in two Eastern European countries.
"We're very close to making an announcement," Fogarassy told journalists at MMK's half-year earnings conference.
Fogarassy declined to reveal the price for its Solnice stake, which has been taken over by MMK subsidiary E. Schausberger & Co GmbH.
The Czech plant near Hradec Kralove could also export to Poland and the Ukraine, he said, adding MMK plans "a wide-reaching investment programme." He gave no details.
