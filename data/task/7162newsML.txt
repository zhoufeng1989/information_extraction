Shares in German energy group Viag AG fell 5.50 marks or 0.9 percent to 561 marks on Wednesday after the company reported a 21 percent fall in first-half pre-tax profit to 1.18 billion marks late on Tuesday.
The profit fall was slightly bigger than expected and Viag's shares underperformed the overall market, with the blue-chip DAX index down 15.37 points or 0.6 percent at the same time.
Viag said the year-earlier profit was swollen by one-off gains from divestments and predicted its 1996 net profit would at least match 1995's 1.32 billion marks.
