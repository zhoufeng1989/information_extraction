Arel noted in a statement that the net loss, the first in eight years, was previously estimated by the company on July 8.
It said the loss arose from "the decreased level of revenues in the second quarter as well as from an increased level of research and development and marketing expenses relating primarily to the company's IDEAL system and the integration of its i-fax technology into its product line".
"The company expects that it will return to profitability after it has successfully marketed its IDEAL system and successfully integrated the i-fax technology into its product line."
Arel is a maker of value-added telecommunication network service systems. It also makes IDEAL, interactive distance learning solutions for the training and educational markets.
