Bell Atlantic Corp said on Thursday that it and Eastern TeleLogic Corp, a competitive local exchange carrier, have filed a joint petition for arbitration to establish interconnection agreements in Pennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey.
Bell Atlantic said that both companies have been in talks since March.
The company said that although Eastern TeleLogic and Bell Atlantic have reached agreement on a number of issues, others remain unresolved, thereby requiring the two companies to file for arbitration, as mandated by the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
