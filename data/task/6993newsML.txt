Washington Public Power Supply System's 1,112 megawatt (MW) WNP 2 nuclear power plant, which is operating at reduced power, is expected to begin ramping up to full power in early September, the company said Tuesday.
"We're holding it at 64 percent. It's an estimate, but today we expect to resume the power ascension program in the first week in September," said company spokesman Richard Romanelli.
The Richland, Wash., unit has been operating at reduced power for more than a month.
Repairs were made in early August to a feedwater pump. Testing has also been underway on the adjustable speed drive and digital feedwater software, which are part of the plant's new computer system.
