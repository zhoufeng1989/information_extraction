Control of day-to-day operations at Kenwin will be transferred to D&A, it said.
D&A will own 526,818 of Kenwin's outstanding shares and have the right to vote 610,796 shares, or 61.1 percent of the outstanding stock, Kenwin said.

D&A will provide inventory to Kenwin's women's apparel shops. In an interim emergency measure, about $1 million in inventory is being shipped to the stores, Kenwin said.
D&A intends to buy from Kenwin all of its authorized, but unissued, shares and treasury shares at $0.01 per share.
D&A also will acquire 83,978 shares from relatives of the founders of Kenwin at a price to be determined by future earnings, but not exeeding $4.50 a share.
The family members are retaining 83,978 Kenwin shares but will execute irrevocable proxies to D&A. Kenwin said.  
The transaction must be approved by Kenwin stockholders and is expected to be completed within two months, Kenwin said.  
Kenwin family members will immediately be paid 50 cents per share by D&A. In each year thereafter, they will be paid 10 percent of the company's per share, pre-tax earnings.
In the aggregate, they will be paid no more than $4.50 per share.
