ITT Sheraton, the hotel chain owned by ITT Corp, has ruled itself out of the auction for the 17 hotels that are part of Forte's Exclusive chain, the Financial Times said.
Granada Group Plc, which acquired the hotels as part of its purchase of Forte last January, is in the process of auctioning off the luxury chain.
ITT Sheraton, which initially expressed an interest in the Exclusive hotels, said it has not made any bids, the newspaper said.
Granada chief executive Charles Allen said: "There is big interest in individual hotels, in groups of hotels and in the whole portfolio," the Financial Times reported.
The Exclusive hotels include the Hyde Park Hotel and Grosvenor House in London, the Ritz in Madrid, and the George V in Paris.
The Financial Times said Grosvenor House had been expected to fetch a bid of about 400 million stg, but it is thought to have received a top bid of about 300 million stg.
About 40 bidders remain and some are interested in acquiring Forte's 68 percent stake in the Savoy group of luxury hotels, the newspaper said.
