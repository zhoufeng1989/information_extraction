Consolidated Edison Co of New York Inc's (Con-Ed) 975 megawatt Indian Point 2 nuclear power unit is in restart mode and expected to reach full production within the next 24 hours, a spokeswoman said Wednesday.
"We are going through the restart procedure, and we should follow that to 100 percent hopefully within the next 24 hours," said company spokeswoman Joan Burger.
The unit, located along the Hudson River about 50 miles north of New York City, tripped off line late Monday due to the failure of a minor piece of electrical equipment, Burger said.
