Learmonth & Burchett Management Systems Plc said on Thursday it expects to post an $18 million restructuring charge for the second quarter ended October 31, 1996.
This charge is expected to relate primarily to lease and severance costs, the company said.
The company wants to focus more on development and marketing of its Process Engineer software, the company said. The company will eliminate substantially all on-going operating costs outside the United States as it shifts direct sales roles to distributors, Learmonth & Burchett said.
