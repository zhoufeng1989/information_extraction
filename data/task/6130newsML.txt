The captain of the port of Coatzacoalcos confirmed Wednesday that the crude export port of Pajaritos, which comes under his juridiction, has been closed to all shipping.
"The port of Pajaritos was closed for leaving ships this morning," Juan Francisco Resendez Estrada told Reuters in a telephone interview. He explained it was obviously open for incoming vessels that needed to take shelter from Tropical Storm Dolly.
Pajaritos in the state of Veracruz is one of three crude export terminals closed because of the threatening weather system.
State-owned oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos said earlier Wednesday its three Gulf of Mexico ports -- Pajaritos alongside Dos Bocas and Cayo Arcas in Campeche state -- had closed because of the threat from Dolly.
Another port source at Coatzacoalcos, just four km (2.5 miles) from Pajaritos said the crude port had been closed since 0800 (1300 GMT) Wednesday. "The crude fleet is not moving," he said.
