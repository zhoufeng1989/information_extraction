-- J.C. Bradford analyst Elliot Laurence said he cut his rating on Urban Outfitters Inc because the stock's performance had not quite lived up to Wall Street's expectations.
-- "Although the results are positive and the stock has performed extremely well over the last six months, we did not see the magnitude of outperformance which had been anticipated," Laurence said. "Based on these levels, there is more risk than reward."
-- Shares were down 3-3/8 at 21-1/8 on Tuesday afternoon.
