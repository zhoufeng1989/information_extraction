Argentina's oil firm YPF SA said on Wednesday the operations of its Maxus Energy Corp subsidiary in Ecuador, which the Quito government has banned, account for only one percent of its sales.
"The income from this operation represents approximately one percent of the consolidated sales of YPF SA and its results are not significant," the company said in a statement.
Ecuador's government announced late on Tuesday that it was banning Maxus from continuing its operations in Ecuador until it reaches a joint-venture deal with state-owned Petroecuador.
But YPF president Nells Leon told Reuters that Maxus was still operating normally on Wednesday. He said negotiations to reach a new agreement were under way with Petroecuador.
