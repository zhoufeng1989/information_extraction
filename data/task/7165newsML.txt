French retailer Promodes expects its first-half net attributable profit to be higher despite lower operating profits, a company executive said on Wednesday.
Finance executive Alexandre Roeser told Reuters the company reaffirmed its forecast for an increase of between 10-15 percent in the full-year 1996 net attributable profit.
"The forecasts of higher consolidated profits for the 1996 year, as made at an analysts' meeting in May, are not in question," he said.
Promodes expects its operating profit for the first six months to be lower compared to a year ago, but financial results and exceptional gains will allow the group to offset that and post a higher net attributable result than the comparable 1995 period.
It posted 288 million francs net attributable profit in the first half 1995. It made 1996 first-half sales of 49.38 billion francs.  
Promodes is due to announce its first-half profit on September 10. It posted 1995 net attributable profit of 1.02 billion francs.
It expects a consumer recovery and customer promotions in the second half to boost net attributable profit for the year, although it could not estimate by how much.
Promodes shares cut their losses after the forecast and were down six francs at 1,210, or 0.49 percent, at 1047 GMT, after hitting a day-low of 1,171. The wider market was down 0.72 percent.
