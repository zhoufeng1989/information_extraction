Indonesia's PT Inti Indorayon Utama said on Wednesday it was considering acquiring the chemical assets of PT Riau Andalan Pulp and Paper and selling its power plants to increase efficiency following recent weak performance.
"We are considering acquiring the chemical assets of Riau Andalan and selling the power plants of Indorayon in an effort to increase efficiency," corporate secretary P. Daritan told Reuters.
Both Inti Indorayon and Riau Andalan belong to New York-listed Asia Pacific Resources International Holdings Ltd (April) which has its administrative office in Singapore.  
Daritan said the firm expected the purchase of the chemical assets, used in the production of pulp and paper, to strengthen its chemical division.
He said the plans were expected to materialise next year, but declined to give further details saying Indorayon was still calculating the figures.
The effeciency effort was neccessary following the firm's weak 1996 first six months results, he said.
Indorayon posted a net loss of 18.71 billion rupiah in the first six months of 1996 against a net profit of 89.25 billion rupiah in the same period last year.
It has an annual capacity of 60,000 tonnes of rayon fibre.
