Crown Pacific Partners L.P. said Thursday it had agreed to acquire lumber wholesaler Maywood-Anderson Forest Products Inc.
Crown said it expects to close the deal on September 1, paying about $3 million, including working capital, for Maywood-Anderson.
Crown said all Maywood-Anderson employees will keep their jobs, including President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Weeks,  who will become vice president of marketing and sales for Crown after the merger.
Maywood-Anderson's 1995 revenues were $87 million.
Crown said the acquisition will increase revenues, earnings and cash flow.
Shares of Crown were 3/8 higher at 19-7/8 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
