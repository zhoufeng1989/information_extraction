RMP Properties Ltd said on Thursday it expected profits in the current year to be 25 percent below those of a year ago.
There would consequently be a similar decrease in the final dividend, it added in a statement.  
The company had previously forecast a 15 percent rise in profits this year, despite a slide in pre-exceptional income in the first half to March 31, 1996, to 7.4 million rand from 10.6 million.  
But the company said there had been a major deterioration in business confidence due to the plunging rand, higher interest rates, uncertainty surrounding tax on institutional property investments, and high levels of crime and violence.
