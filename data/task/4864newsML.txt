Chip producer Austria Mikro Systeme International AG said on Tuesday it expects parent sales and earnings in the second half of 1996 to be on a par with those posted in the first six months.
Earlier, AMS reported parent first-half sales of 710.4 million schillings versus 814 million, pre-tax of 128.35 million versus 102.15 million and net profit of 102.33 million versus 102.15 million.  
"Sales in the second half will not stand out because of any extreme hikes," chief executive Horst Gebert told Reuters. -- Vienna newsroom, +431 531 12274
