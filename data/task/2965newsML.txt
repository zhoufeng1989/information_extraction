A group led by FMR Corp said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Tuesday it holds a 10.26 percent stake in Alliance Gaming Corp or 3,271,086 common shares.
The group disclosed its latest position on Alliance in a 13G filing. FMR Corp is the parent of the investment adviser to Fidelity Funds.
Filings under 13G are usually made by institutions and large investors with "passive" investment objectives in a company. Unlike 13D filings, those reports do not list the latest transactions.
