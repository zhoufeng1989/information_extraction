Merrill Lynch and Co is making little headway in trying to charge fund companies above the going rate for a variety of "no-loan" mutual funds, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.
Merrill, the biggest brokerage house on Wall Street, is expected make its long-awaited entry into the no-load "supermarket" arena perhaps as early as next month, perhaps as soon as after the Labor Day holiday at the start of September.
The idea is to let Merrill customers trade no-load mutual funds from at least 10 unrelated fund companies without going outside the big brokerage house.
However, Merrill has not yet managed to persuade any participating fund families to pay a higher rate to Merrill than they already fork over to be in rival supermarket programs such as Charles Schwab Corp's.
Merrill wants to collect as much as a 0.4 percentage point of all new dollars flowing into fund companies through its new program, industry sources told the newspaper.
That amounts to $4 for every $1,000 invested. But the fund companies so far are balking, and holding out for as little as 0.25 percentage point.
"Merrill Lynch is big enough to think they can demand more," said an unidentified executive at a no-load fund company.
No-load funds are mutual funds offered by an open-end investment company that imposes no sales charge, or "load," on its shareholders.
The outcome is important to fund shareholders. If fund companies start paying a premium to be in a supermarket, the costs will eventually filter down to investors.
