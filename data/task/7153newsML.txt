Austria's blue-chip insurer Wiener Staedtische Allgemeine Versicherung AG said on Wednesday it had launched insurance services in neighbouring southern Germany as part of its European expansion programme.
The company said it would intitially focus on products which were cheaper than those already available in Germany or which did not yet exist in the form offered by Wiener Staedtische.
Among the services mentioned were private pensions, accident and home-owner's insurance.
"We certainly won't be moving into the mass market of automobile insurance," Wiener Staedtische director Hans Raumauf told Reuters.
Raumauf declined to comment on the projected insurance premium volume.
The company said sales would be managed by independent agents and agencies, adding it was not yet planning its own local sales for financial reasons. -- Vienna newsroom +43 1 531-12-257
