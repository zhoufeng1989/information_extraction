New Zealand co-operative financial services organisation PSIS said on Thursday it had passed the NZ$300 million mark on July 31 for total deposits.
Chief executive John Price said PSIS was presently exceeding its target of 10 percent a year growth in deposits.  
"If the present trend continues, we should end the year with another round of good news. That will be three years in a row of healthy, growing results," Price said after PSIS's annual meeting.
He said new products and product enhancements were planned in the new financial year, and customer service and sales training sessions would be increased.
Price said not only would the new products offered in future be keenly competitive within the whole financial services market, but they would also reflect PSIS's co-operative goal of providing members with additional rewards.  
PSIS has 27 branches throughout New Zealand and 140,000 customers. -- Wellington Newsroom (64 4) 4734746
