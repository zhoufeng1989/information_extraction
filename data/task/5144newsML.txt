Hyundai Motor Co Ltd, the flagship of Hyundai Group, said on Wednesday it plans to enter the mini-car market in late 1997.
"We plan to start selling our mini-cars in late 1997 at the earliest," said a spokesman for Hyundai, South Korea's largest car maker.
He said the company would set up new automobile lines in its Ulsan complex capable of producing 120,000 to 150,000 mini-cars annually. The ultra sub-compact cars would have an engine capacity of 800 cc and 1,000 cc, he said.
"We plan to export the 1,000 cc mini-cars to Southeast Asian and European countries, while the 800 cc units would be sold domestically," the spokesman said.
"Domestic demand for mid- to large-sized sedans is seen on the down trend, while that for smaller cars is increasing," he said. "So we have high expectation for the mini-car market."
South Korea's mini-car market is currently dominated by Daewoo Motor's "Tico".
