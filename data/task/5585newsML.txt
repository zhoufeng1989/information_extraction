Greater China Corp said on Wednesday it had agreed to merge with Beijing's Newsdata Network Systems Co Ltd, a supplier of wireless data communications and networking systems that is partially owned by China's official Xinhua News Agency.
The merger, in which both parties would be equal partners, is expected to be completed on or before September 15, 1996, the company said.
Financial terms were not immediately available.  
The merger will make Greater China the first international publicly traded company in the information service business in China, Greater China said.
Newsdata Network holds a twenty-year license for two government authorized wireless transmission frequencies available for use throughout China and holds patents on wireless technology, Greater China said.
Newsdata Network supplies live stock quotes from the Shanghai and Shenzhen Exchanges as well as other pertinent trading reports and business information, Greater China said.
Newsdata Network has the capability of delivering over 160 channels of information and also provides an e-mail package, Greater China said.  
Greater China chief executive officer John Allen said the company will be owned 50 percent by Newsdata Network and 50 percent held by Greater China's shareholders.
Greater China's shares are presently listed on the NASD Bulletin Board, but Allen said the company aims to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. He did not give a time line for the listing.
The company's shares will not be traded in China at the present time, Allen said.
Newsdata Network has about $3.5 million in revenues and the company is profitable, Allen said.
Greater China's sales are about $3.5 million for 1995 and had a loss of $695,000, including charges from closing some operations, Greater China said.
