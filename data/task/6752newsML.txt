Note - Mersey Docks and Harbour Company said profits were hit by increased losses from Eurolink, fierce competition on the Irish Sea routes and a 945,000 stg charge from a voluntary severance scheme for Liverpool port employees.
It said Eurolink Ferries incurred losses of 4.51 million stg in the period and that it would withdraw from the passenger service by the end of the year.
