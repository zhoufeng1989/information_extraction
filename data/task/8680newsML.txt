SDL Inc said Wednesday it expects revenues for the third quarter to be "at best" unchanged from the second quarters $21.6 million due to manufacturing difficulties.
"SDL continues to experience production yield problems," Donald Scifres, chief executive, said in a statement. "These yield problems...until rectified, can be expected to delay certain product and system shipments."
SDL, a maker of semiconductor- and fiber optic-related products for telecommunications, said if a timely solution can be found, fourth quarter revenues could begin to increase.  
Scifres added the company has been addressing its problems, but identifying a solution has "proven more difficult" than expected.
SDL shares were off nine at 19 by mid-afternoon Thursday.
