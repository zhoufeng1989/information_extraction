German telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom AG said on Wednesday that it would also seek to list its shares on stock exchanges in Canada as part of its November flotation.
Telekom chief financial officer Joachim Kroeske told reporters the company was in negotiations about listing its shares in Toronto and Quebec. The company has said in the past that it aimed to list shares in New York and Tokyo.
"The goal of the planned flotation in November is a broad international listing," Kroeske said.
Kroeske also said that in addition to listing shares on Germany's largest stock exchange in Frankfurt, it would list stock on the other seven regional bourses.
Telekom expects to gain around 15 billion marks from its November listing, making it one of the largest initial public offerings ever in Europe.
