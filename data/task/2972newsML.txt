Technology Flavors & Fragrances Inc said on Tuesday it appointed Joseph Gemmo as its chief financial officer.
Gemmo was most recently chief financial officer of Bio-Bontanica, a company involved in herbal extracts.
Technology Flavors has not had a chief financial officer for nearly a year and the company's secretary-treasurer was previously fulfilling the chief financial officer's duties, a company spokesman said.
