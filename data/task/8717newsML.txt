Star Technologies Inc and Electronic Instrumentation and Technology said Thursday they plan to merge.
Terms of the merger were not immediately disclosed. However, Star is expected to pay EIT shareholders about $5 million, including cash and Star stock, the companies said.
Following the merger of the two Virginia-based engineering and manufacturing firms, the privately held EIT will become a division of Star.
EIT founder and President Joe May will receive an equity position in Star and become president of the EIT Division.
