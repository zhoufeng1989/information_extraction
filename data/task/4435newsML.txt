Petronor, part of the Repsol group, said its refinery in Spain's Basque Country had closed on Monday as expected.
Workers called a strike, the sixth this year, from 1500 GMT Monday until 0400 GMT on Monday, August 26.
The plant takes about 12 hours to regain full production after a stoppage, the spokesman said. It should therefore  be back to full strength around 1600 GMT next Monday.
The refinery has a capacity of 230,000 barrels per day (bpd) but usually refines an average of 200,000 bpd.
It will compensate for some of the lost production -- perhaps around half -- by increasing output after the strike, the spokesman said.
Other refineries in the Repsol group have also contributed to covering Petronor's shortfall in past strikes.
