European rating agency IBCA said on Tuesday it affirmed Slough Estates Plc's long-term A minus and short-term A2 ratings.  
"The maintained rating reflects Slough's place as the UK's largest industrial property investment company and fifth largest overall," IBCA said in a statement.
"Disposal of interests in Australia will fund part of the current 175 million stg development programme while a large proportion of major developments are either pre-sold or pre-let," IBCA said.
"The roles of chairman and chief executive were divided earlier this year and the director responsible for the UK development and acquisition programme resigned. Management state these changes will not affect the group's existing strategy."  
IBCA said broadly maintained gearing demonstrates managed growth through new developments and redevelopment of existing sites.
"The uncertain outlook for the property market and low inflation means that further expansion will most probably come through this source rather than acquisitions," IBCA said.
"Financial coverages remain satisfactory and continue to be supported by the secure UK rental income stream," it said.
