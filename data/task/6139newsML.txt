Compania de Telecomunicaciones de Chile's credit quality should remain steady due to its solid position in the local market, Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co said.
"CTC remains in a strong competitive position in the Chilean telecommunications market," said a statement datelined in Chicago.
The advent of the multicarrier long-distance system in late 1994 cut into revenues last year, said the statement.  
"However, productivity gains allowed CTC to reduce operating costs by nine percent between year-end 1994 and 1995, which resulted in an 8.1 percent increase in operating income," it said.
The agency currently rates CTC's senior debt A-minus and its convertible subordinate debentures BBB-plus, it said.
