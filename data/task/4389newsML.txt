Shipping and tank storage firm Koninklijke van Ommeren NV said on Tuesday it expected the 1996 full-year net profit to be clearly higher than 1995's 80.3 million guilders.
"Barring unforeseen circumstances, we expect a clearly higher net profit for the whole of 1996," the company said in a statement after posting a 15 percent higher first-half profit.  
Van Ommeren said its first-half operating profit had risen by 2.4 million guilders to 77.8 million. It said the 1995 figure included an unspecified gain on the sale of ships, adding it had changed its accounting principles at the beginning of 1996.
Adjusted for these effects, the first-half operating profit would have risen by 17.8 million guilders. Tank storage operations in Asia and the tanker shipping division in particular contributed to this improvement, Van Ommeren said.
First-half turnover fell by 77.7 million guilders to 365.9 million, partly due to the previously announced sale of a 51 percent stake in the company's dry cargo shipping business.  
Adjusted for the effect of this sale, first-half turnover would have shown a rise of 73.7 million guilders.
This underlying growth in turnover was caused by the consolidation of unit Chemgas' figures, takeovers in the tank storage sector and improved business at the dry cargo terminals operations in the United States, Van Ommeren said.
