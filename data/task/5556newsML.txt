Reddi Brake Supply Corp said on Wednesday it was suspending indefinitely any further conversions of its class A preferred stock and class B preferred stock, pending a company probe into unusual trading activity.
The company said it would issue a further statement at such a time as the suspension is lifted.
On August 13, Reddi Brake announced that it is in talks with class B preferred stockholders to restructure conversion rights, since selling of the shares after the conversion had put pressure on the company's stock.
