Latinvest Securities Ltd on Thursday reiterated its strong buy' recommendation for Brazilian autoparts manufacturer Cofap.
"Our recommendation is based on a sharp turnaround in earnings and the stock's underperformance in the past year," Latinvest said in a note to investors on Thursday.
In 1995, the company invested heavily to rationalise its production logistics completely.
"Now it is moving on to a new phase in its growth strategy -- globalisation -- by strengthening its relationship with Mahle, Chrysler and Fiat," said Latinvest.
Latinvest said that as a result of this strategy, operating profit should jump to R$37 million in 1996 and R$48 million in 1997 from just R$2 million in 1995.
Net profit should rise to R$19 million in 1966 and R$30 million in 1997 from R$17 million in losses last year, it added.
