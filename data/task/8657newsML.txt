The president of takeover target Arequipa Resources Ltd said Thursday there is a good chance another company will take on Barrick Gold Corp with a rival takeover bid for the junior gold company.
"I would say there's probably a 40 to 50 percent chance of another bid appearing, and it probably will be today or tomorrow," Arequipa president Catherine McLeod told Canada AM, a morning television show on CTV.
Arequipa has already accepted a C$30 a share offer from Barrick.  
All Arequipa directors, including McLeod, and some shareholders have agreed to tender about 23 percent of shares under a lock-up agreement with Barrick.
Under the deal, Barrick will receive a fee of C$18 million if there is a rival bid of at least C$31.50 a share that Barrick does not match.
Analysts have said ony a handful of companies would be able to top Barrick's bid, which offers Arequipa shareholders all cash or a mix of cash and shares.
Vancouver-based Arequipa's main asset is the Pierina gold deposit in Peru. Experts have speculated the deposit may have potential reserves of up to 12 million ounces of high-quality gold. But they noted exploration is still in its early stages.
