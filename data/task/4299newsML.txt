General Motors Corp's Oldsmobile division is scaling back the dealerships it plans to close to 746, about half the number it had targeted early this year, USA Today reported on Tuesday.
According to an internal document obtained by the newspaper, Oldsmobile told top dealers last month it would like to shut 746, or 25 percent, of its showrooms, leaving 2,236.
Reports in January said Oldsmobile wanted to close 1,400 dealerships.
An Oldsmobile spokeskman said the division was not anxious to slice deeper than 25 percent because it needs the dealerships to sell a wave of products planned the next year, including a new Cutlass sedan and Intrigue midsize car.
The memo said Oldsmobile hoped to close 190 of 537 dealerships in major cities and suburban markets with more than one Oldsmobile showroom.
Oldsmobile is targeting 556 of 2,445 showrooms in small towns and midsize cities with one Oldsmobile dealer each.
