Atlantic Richfield Co (ARCO) signed an agreement Wednesday to form a joint venture worth $3.5 billion to produce and upgrade heavy crude with Corpoven, a unit of Venezuela's state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA).
ARCO chairman Mike Bowlin (corrects title and spelling of name) and Corpoven President Guillermo Archila signed the agreement at a news conference in Caracas.
Under the joint venture, the companies will work together to produce 200,000 barrels per day of 9-degree API extra-heavy crude oil from the Hamaca zone in Venezuela's Orinoco tar belt.  
Archila said the agreement "is a step of great importance for PdVSA," and part of the Venezuelan oil industry's gradual opening to private capital.
The project will have three phases including construction of a pipeline and an upgrading unit on the Caribbean coast at Jos, north of the field, by 2001.
By 2006 the joint venture will be converting 180,000 bpd of heavy crude into 25-degree API crude, similar in quality to Alaskan North Slope crude, the companies said.
The joint venture, first conceived in September 1994, still requires Congressional approval.
