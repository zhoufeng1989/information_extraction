PXRE Corp and Transnational Re Corp said Thursday they have signed an agreement to merge.
Under the agreement, Transnational will be merged into PXRE and will cease to exist once the transaction is completed. The deal between the two reinsurance companies is expected to be closed by the end of this year's fourth quarter.
Each share of Transnational's common stock will be exchanged for 1.0575 shares of PXRE's common stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares, the companies said.
