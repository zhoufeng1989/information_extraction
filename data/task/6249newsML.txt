Jurong Shipyard Ltd should see a slight improvement in its second half results if the ship repair market remains stable, chairman Lua Cheng Eng said on Wednesday.
"We should see some improvement in second half results if market conditions remain as the first half," Lua told reporters after the group announced its interim results.
Jurong reported a 31 percent fall in net profit to Singapore $15.45 million (US$10.95 million) for the six months ended June 30.
The results were largely in line with market expectations, which have been bearish on shipyards for some time.
"Jurong's results were within expectations going by the interim results of the other yards released so far," said Koh Bee Ann, an investment analyst with GK Goh Securities.
Lua said the ship repair market continued depressed in the first half of the year and competition remained keen among local and overseas yards.
Jurong repaired 102 vessels during the period, which was almost the same as the second half of 1995, he said.
He said Jurong's new dock, which started operations in July, should have a capacity of about 40 vessels for the remaining five months of the year with the contract value for each vessel expected to be about S$1 million.
Lua said the new dock should be able to attract new business because it can accommodate larger vessels.
Because of the fall in earnings, Jurong has halved its interim dividend payout to 3.75 cents or 7.5 percent per share, Lua said.
