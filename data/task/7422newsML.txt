Shares of Guangdong Investment Ltd surged 20 cents, or 3.74 percent, to HK$5.55 in early trade on Wednesday after the company's parent announced a share placement and subscription for new shares.
Brokers said the placement price discount of 2.43 percent to the previous close was relatively small which indicated investor optimism about so-called "red chips" -- or Hong Kong-listed companies with substantive Chinese interests.
But brokers said they saw resistence emerging.
"The counter should see immediate resistance at HK$5.60," a broker at Sassoon Securities said.
Trading of Guangdong Investment was suspended on Tuesday afternoon pending the announcement by its parent, Guangdong Enterprises (Holdings) Ltd, about the placement of 80 million existing shares and subsciption for the same number of existing shares. Trade resumed on Wednesday.
