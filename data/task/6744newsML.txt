Newly-floated Jarvis Hotels Plc said on Wednesday it had bought the hotel trading as Holiday Inn Gatwick East from Scandic Hotels Group for 8.62 million stg cash.
The company also said that room yield had grown 15 percent since March 31, 1996. "Forward commercial bookings for the Autumn reinforce this trend," it noted in the statement.  
The hotel at Gatwick airport has 151 bedrooms, conference facilities and a health and leisure club.
"The acquisition of this hotel demonstrates Jarvis's commitment to offer good value mid-market properties to our corporate and leisure clients and I am confident of its future trading," said chairman and chief executive John Jarvis.
