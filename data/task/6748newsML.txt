Moorfield Estates Plc said its rights issue had been 49.69 percent taken up on the market by the closing date of August 20.
It said the new shares not taken up had been conditionally placed by Hoare Govett Corporate Finance at 28 pence per share.
The issue, aimed at raising 14.45 million stg, was launched on July 30.
Moorfield said then it would use proceeds to finance a 12 million stg property purchase from Refuge Assurance and to reduce debts.
Moorfield said the offer and placing were conditional on passing a special resolution at an extraordinary general meeting on August 27.
