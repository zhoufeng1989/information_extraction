Average commitment rates on U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose slightly to 7.93 percent in the week ending August 23 from 7.88 percent the previous week, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp said Thursday.
Freddie Mac said 15-year loans also rose to an average 7.45 percent from 7.39 percent last week.
But adjustable-rate mortgages declined to 5.79 percent from 5.81 percent last week.
A year ago, the 30-year rate averaged 7.88 percent, the 15-year 7.39 percent, and the ARM 5.96 percent.  
"Inflation remains in check amid some evidence that economic growth has slowed a little," Frank Nothaft, Freddie Mac deputy chief economist, said. He noted that U.S. housing starts have declined over the past several months.
"All these factors combined worked together to keep interest rates below eight percent for the last three weeks," Nothaft added.
The Commerce Department last Friday said U.S. July housing starts fell 1.3 percent after declining 0.3 percent in June.
On Tuesday, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave interest rates unchanged. The FOMC next meets on September 24.
Freddie Mac said lenders charged an average 1.7 percent in fees and points on 30- and 15-year loans, both unchanged from last week. They charged 1.4 percent on the ARM, also unchanged from the previous week.
