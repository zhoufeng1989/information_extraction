U.S. Food and Drug Administration has cleared Procter & Gamble Co's request to market a prescription duodenal ulcer drug therapy, the company said on Thursday.  
Procter and Gamble said it planned to begin selling its patented drug therapy in mid-November, promoting it among health care professionals and managed care organizations.
The drug, called Helidac Therapy, combines three drugs, namely bismuth subsalicylate, metronidazole and tetracycline hydrochloride, it said.
The company said the drug eradicates the bacterium "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)" from the stomach and small intestine and, in combination with an H2 antagonist, helps heal ulcers.
The bacteria cause about 90 percent of duodenal ulcers, which afflict about one in 12 people during their lifetime, it said.
