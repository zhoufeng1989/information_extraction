Metromedia International Group Inc said on Wednesday it agreed a joint venture with state-owned Golden Cellular Corp of China to provide fixed wireless telephone systems.
The joint venture is called Mei Ti-Jinfeng and recently received a Chinese license to provide local telephones for homes and businesses supported by wireless technology. The license also covers software and maintenance.
Metromedia uses the Multispan technology developed by DSC Communications Corp which allows customers to be connected without the cost of laying cables.
Only 4.7 percent of Chinese households have a telephone and the government is planning to add 25 million to the network every year for 15 years, Metromedia said.
No financial details were given but a source close to Metromedia said the investment for the project could total tens of millions of dollars. -- Nick Louth, New York Newsroom 212 859 1712
