Shareholders of Paints and Chemical Industries/PACHIN accepted on Wednesday the board's proposal to split the company shares 10 for one.
The new shares will have a nominal value of 10 pounds instead of 100 pounds and there will be 10 million issued in place of the one million old shares.
The board said the change would stimulate trade in the shares on the Egyptian stock exchange, where the old shares have a bulky market value of 790 pounds.
Brokers said this week that the share-split scheme had already pushed the share price upwards.
