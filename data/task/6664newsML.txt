Britain's 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) Killingholme refinery in northwest England has trimmed runs, an industry official familiar with the refinery said.
Runs were reduced because of poor profit margins, the official said, but declined to say by exactly how much throughput was cut.
But other trade sources said the reduction amounted to about 10,000-15,000 bpd.
Killingholme is owned jointly by Belgian Petrofina SA and French Total SA.
