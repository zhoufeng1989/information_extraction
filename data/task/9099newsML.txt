NOTE - The bank said despite a generally more optimistic outlook for the Zimbabwean economy this year, significant business failures had occurred during the last six months and a number of quoted companies had issued warnings of lower than forecast results.
It said with many more financial institutions now operating in the market seeking a share of available business, margins continued to be squeezed and its banking operations showed only modest growth although it had achieved a general increase in business volumes. It however forecast a continuing strong growth in profits for the full year.
