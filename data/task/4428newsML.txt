The Italian antitrust watchdog on Tuesday gave the green light to state company Finmeccanica to press ahead with plans to sell its Alenia unit's 50 percent stake in Mac-Alenia Marconi Communications.
Finmeccanica said in June it planned to sell the stake for 247 billion lire to its equal partner in the joint venture, Marconi SpA -- a unit of U.K. group GEC,
Mac-Alenia Marconi specialises in civilian and military radiocommunications and telematics.
The anti-trust said in its weekly statement that the deal would not substantially alter the sector concerned.
