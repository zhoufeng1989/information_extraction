Swedish commercial bank Swedbank reported on Thursday a healthy leap in profits for the first half of 1996, with income rising, credit losses falling and profitability back to pre-crisis levels.
Operating profit for the period rose 46 percent to 2.47 billion crowns ($373.5 million), Swedbank said in a statement, an improvement of 782 million crowns on the 1.69 billion posted for the first half of 1995.
All of the Swedish banks that have so far published their half-year profits have reported a normalisation of credit loss levels, and Swedbank was no exception.
The bank's loan losses for the period fell to 905 million crowns from 1.35 billion, and loan losses expressed as a percentage of total lending volume is now down at 0.5 percent, close to the level that prevailed before the credit crash of the early 1980s. ($ = 6.613 Swedish Crowns)
