Otis Elevator Co Ltd expected a coming boom in China's housing sector to give a lift to its sales, company officials said on Tuesday.
Beijing's plan to increase the average per capita living space to 12 from seven square metres by 2000 would provide huge opportunities for Otis, Pier Luigi Foschi, executive vice president of Otis' Pacific Asia division, told a news briefing.
The firm's sales in China grew last year by 30 percent to about $300 million and were expected to increase a further 20 percent this year, Foschi said.
Foschi estimated China's elevator and escalator demand to be as high as 32,000 units a year, making it the largest market in the world.
Otis has invested $100 million in joint ventures in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou, employing 5,000 people.
