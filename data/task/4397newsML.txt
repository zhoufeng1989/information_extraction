Austrian oil and chemicals group OMV said on Tuesday a test well off the coast of Albania had yielded no oil but the firm said it had located new prospective fields.
OMV began drilling the 5,000 metre Rodoni one test well in January, four kilometres offshore.
"The drill did not find any oil carrying layers but there are other prospective areas in our exploration area," chief executive Richard Schenz told a news conference.
"In 1997 we are planning a new seismic study and in 1998 we will start fresh drilling."
Schenz confirmed OMV's interest in onshore oil exploration in Albania. He said the company would find out in the autumn whether it had been successful in its bid for a licence.
OMV was also aware of potential in North Africa, Schenz said. The firm is already active in Libya.
"In geographic terms North Africa is interesting for us because of the Trieste supply route," he said.
Schenz announced the group would invest around 1.5 billion schillings in exploration and production this year.
