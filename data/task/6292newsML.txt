Shares in HSBC Holdings and CITIC Pacific Ltd closed at all-time highs on Wednesday, buoyed by the market's firm tone after the U.S. Federal Reserve's left interest rates unchanged.
CITIC Pacific rose HK$0.50, or 1.44 percent, to HK$35.20 and HSBC rose HK$2.00, or 1.49 percent, to HK$136.00. Both are constituents of the Hang Seng blue chip index.
"High liquidity means investment funds are coming into the market and the blue chip sector is the first sector investment funds will normally buy," said Ben Kwong, director of research at Dharmala Securities.  -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6370
