Finnish insurance group Pohjola Oy said in a statement on Thursday it expected its underwriting result in 1996 to be poorer than 1995.
"Underwriting result (1996) is forecast to be poorer than that for 1995," Pohjola said.
In 1995, the underwriting result was a 214 million markka loss, and in the first half this year it was a 191 million markka loss.  
"In view of the slow increase in premiums written and trend in claims incurred, domestic direct insurance is forecast to develop along the same lines as in the first half of the year," Pohjola said.
Pohjola said its January-June operating profit rose to 466 million markka from 270 million on the back of net investment income which soared to 657 million markka from 234 million. It gave no outlook for investment income or the operating profit.
"The price development of securities and the exchange rates will have an impact on the investment income and solvency level during the latter half of the year," it noted.
"The bulk of dividends accrues in the first half of the year," it added.
Pohjola said the real estate markets still seemed to pick up slowly.
