Elcor Corp said on Tuesday it expects strong demand for its Enhanced High Definition and Raised Profile Prestique shingles to boost shipments and sales to record levels for the first quarter of fiscal 1997.  
This trend will result in substantially higher sales for all of fiscal 1997 as well, the company said.
It said it still expects earnings per share for fiscal 1997 to be $1.30 to $1.50, up from $1.16 in fiscal 1996.
In the earlier quarters of fiscal 1997, the company said, it expects earnings per share to be in the general range of, or possibly lower than, the year-earlier quarters until its Shafter, Calif., plant installs some new equipment and gets the benefit of having all of its higher-value products in its manufacturing schedule.
Start-up of the new nonwoven fiberglass mat production facility at Ennis is going well but the facility will be a drag on earnings during the early part of the fiscal year until output and sales are above the break-even point, the company said.
