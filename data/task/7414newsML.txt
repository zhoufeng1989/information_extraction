Japanese consumer finance firm Minami Kyushu Credit Co Ltd said on Wednesday that it had filed for bankruptcy this morning with debts of 108 billion yen.
Minami Kyushu Credit is an unlisted firm.  
Minami Kyushu Credit, which was formed in 1983, saw its profits rise until 1990, when business started declining due to new rules on loans to non-banks, private research firm Tokyo Shoko Research said in a statement.
Companies to which Minami Kyushu Credit extended loans went bankrupt due to the bursting of the "bubble" economy of inflated land and share prices in the early 1990s and that also had a negative impact on Minami Kyushu Credit's business, Tokyo Shoko Research said.
