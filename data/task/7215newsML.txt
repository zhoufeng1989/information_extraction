Retailer Woolworths Ltd said on Wednesday it plans to start petroleum retailing in the next two to three months.
Woolworths said it intends to start petrol retailing operations in a limited number of selected New South Wales, metropolitan and country locations within or adjacent to shopping centres in which the company is a tenant.
"This proposed new retail activity follows the company's recent commitment to refined petroleum product tank storage facilities and supply arrangements and is subject to local government authorities regarding development of the selected  
sites in these areas," Woolworths said.
It said details of tank storage and product supply were commercially confidential and were not to be disclosed yet.
