The parliament of the Baltic state of Lithuania on Thursday delayed a key vote on whether to merge its four state oil sector companies into one large enterprise, the parliament press service said.
The government wants to merge the Mazheikiu Nafta oil refinery, Butinge oil terminal, a pipeline company and the nationwide chain of service stations Lietuvos Kuras into one national oil company, Lietuvos Nafta (Lithuanian Oil).
The vote was postponed after a procedural row. It was not clear when the vote would be taken but the press service said it may not be until September 10.
The state has to hold 51 percent of Lietuvos Nafta, whose share capital is valued at around 790 million litas, for three years but can then bring its share down to 34 percent.
If the new firm is successful, an emission of around 300 million litas of stock would be made, which could be bought by foreign investors.
The right-wing Homeland Union opposition party wants to exclude the pipelines company from the new firm.
It believes it is too strategic to sell to outside investors, which could include Russian companies.
