Shares in Aur Resources Inc dropped Wednesday after it released results from its gold property in Nevada.
Shares were down C$0.90 to $8.95 on heavy trading of more than one million shares.
Since June, Aur said it has tested about two percent of its Coleman Canyon property located about 100 km north of Elko, Nevada.
"Investors think they've found dead ambers," said mining analyst Ray Goldie with Richardson Greenshields.  
"They haven't, though. They've found a lot of smoke," Goldie said, adding that exploration is still in its early stages.
The company said it was drilling to evaluate the potential for a large tonnage, open pit gold deposit.
Drilling intersected an average grade of 0.02 ounces of gold per tonne over 11.6 metres, the company said in a statement.
Aur said the results confirm the presence of widespread gold mineralization in the area, but the company needs to establish the continuity of ore-grade mineralization.  
The company said it plans to continue drilling and trenching in September.
