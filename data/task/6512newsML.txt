Codelouf & Co hedge fund headed by Luca Padulli has reduced its stake in Italian agri-chemical group Montedison to 0.12 percent, a source close to Montedison said on Wednesday.
An announcement on the change is due to be published in newspapers on Thursday, the source said. At Montedison's June annual general meeting, Codelouf held a stake of just under four percent.
Padulli was reported in May to be dismayed at Montedison's low share price and to have called in a letter to its chairman for the company to break up.  
Montedison managing director Enrico Bondi in June brushed aside calls for a break-up and Padulli said he had no accord with other stockholders to force the company's hand.
Montedison stocks closed 0.08 percent up at 999.4 lire on Wednesday, slightly below the blue-chip Mib30 index. Earlier, a block of 60 million Montedison shares, equal to a stake of 1.52 percent, changed hands at 998 lire a share.
Financial sources said the block had been sold by U.S. investment house Merrill Lynch, although no official confirmation from Merrill's was available.
The bank bought a 3.8 percent stake in Montedison in January 1996, which was then reduced to 2.17 percent.
Italian industrial holding Compart, formerly Ferruzzi Finanziaria SpA, has 33 percent of Montedison's ordinary capital.
