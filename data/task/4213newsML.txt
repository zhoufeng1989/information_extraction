Consolidated Edison Co of New York Inc (Con-Ed) said Tuesday its 975 megawatt (MW) Indian Point 2 nuclear power plant will likely be back on line later today.
The unit tripped off line late Monday.  
"It should be back sometime this afternoon or this evening," said company spokeswoman Joan Burger.
She said the cause of the outage was still unclear but that necessary repairs to the unit were minimal.
"We're still investigating, but we've identified a small piece of electrical equipment which may have caused the unit to trip off line," she said.
The Indian Point facility is about 50 miles north of New York City along the Hudson River.
