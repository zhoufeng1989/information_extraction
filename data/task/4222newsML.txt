Levi Strauss & Co, the 140-year-old jean maker, unveiled a new line of men's dress pants called Slates, marking only the third major brand of clothing to be launched in the company's history.
Levi is backing the launch with a $20 million marketing program that will put the Slates line in as many as 1,500 stores along with its Levi's jeans and Dockers casual slacks by the end of this month.
"We're going to awaken a sleeping giant of a category that we think has enormous potential," Jann Westfall, president of the Slates brand, said in a statement.
