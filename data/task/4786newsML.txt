Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co Ltd said on Tuesday that it has acquired the rights to market U.S. biotech firm Centocor Inc's heart drug, ReoPro, in Japan.
The drug, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1995, is used for treating stricture of the heart and acute cardiac infarction.
Fujisawa will join with Nippon Centocor KK, the U.S. firm's Japanese subsidiary, in the development of the drug in Japan, which is in the second phase of three-stage clinical trials, Fujisawa said in a statement.
The drug is expected to hit the Japanese market in the middle of 2000. Sales are expected to be 1.5 billion yen in the first year, and are likely to reach nine to 10 billion yen at their peak, a Fujisawa spokesman said.
