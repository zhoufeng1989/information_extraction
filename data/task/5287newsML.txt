Profitability at Volvo Car, the biggest division of Swedish automotive group AB Volvo, will improve during autumn as its new S40/V40 car series replaces the older 400-series, Volvo Car managing director Tuve Johannesson said on Wednesday.
"The profitability of the 400 series is useless. The S40/V40 is bringing a change of profitability that will have obvious implications," Johannesson told Reuters in an interview.
He declined to give a precise forecast for Volvo car sales for the second half of 1996 after Volvo car reported a small operating profit of 378 million crowns in Q2 1996 following two quarters of losses.
"The main reason is that we have achieved balance and managed to bring operating costs under control," he said.
The car division's sales fell 7.0 percent to 39.83 billion crowns in the first half of 1996, but new orders for its medium-sized car sector rose 11 percent thanks to the introduction of the new series.
"So far we have received 41,000 client orders for the S40/V40 and produced 30,000 of the new models. We are now over our planned rate of production for the model and are looking for total production this year of between 65,000 and 70,000," Johannesson added.
