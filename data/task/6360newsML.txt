Natural gas flows on Stingray Pipeline Co's offshore U.S. Gulf pipeline will return to normal by 1200 CDT/1300 EDT Thursday following a three-day maintenance outage, the company said Wednesday.
"The line will be back by noon tomorrow at the latest, which is about four hours late," said a company spokeswoman, noting the pipeline would be accepting nominations for tomorrow on a percentage basis.
The line is currently flowing at a rate of approximately 550 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd), compared with the normal rate of about 780 mmcfd.
On the first day of the outage, testing of the electrical current in the system was being done at Holly Beach, offshore Louisiana.
On the remaining two days flows were being curtailed at West Cameron 509 so that the electronic switch gear in the compression system could be tested.
Stingray Pipeline Co is a partnership between a subsidiary of Leviathan Gas Pipeline Partners Ltd and a subsidiary of Natural Gas Pipeline Co of America, which in turn is a unit of Occidental Petroleum.
