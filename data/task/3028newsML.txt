NetVantage Inc Tuesday said it reached an agreement with Silicon Valley Bank to increase its line of credit for working capital purposes and capital equipment to $6 million from $3 million.
According to NetVantage Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thomas Baker, the increase in the existing line of credit will be used to support the increasing working capital needs of the company resulting from the increasing demand for its Ethernet switching products.
