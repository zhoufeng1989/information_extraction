An investment fund bought just over 3.6 percent of Portuguese construction firm Somague-SGPS in pre-trade on the Lisbon bourse, a company spokesman said.
"A fund bought 400,000 shares in Somague. I won't say if it was a national or a foreign fund," Somague's vice president Diogo Vaz Guedes told Reuters.
Somague stood unchanged at 1,100 escudos in volume of 450,200 shares on Lisbon bourse at 0955 GMT.
"Institutional investors are very interested in Somague, and today's operation shows that the market recognised the results of our restructuring and once again considers that we are a big player in Portuguese construction," Vaz Guedes said.
