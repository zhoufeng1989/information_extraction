After three failed attempts, receivers of Venezuela's bankrupt Aeropostal will take the airline company to the auction block for a fourth time on August 30.
"If none of the other creditors have any objections, the auction will be Friday next week," Servio Altuve, one of the airline's receivers, told a meeting of the board of creditors.  
A base price is yet to be set, but sources told Reuters it would be around $24 million, down from the last auction's $32 million base price.
Five groups of investors expressed interest in the airline during the creditors' meeting: England's World Aviation Group, the Venezuelan-U.S. consortium Alas; a consortium of former Aeropostal pilots and Delta Airlines executives; Venezuela's Zuliana de Aviacion; and the Venezuelan consortium Cavendes- Laser.
The airline's first auction attempt failed in July 1994 when the Venezuelan Investment Fund delcared void an an 80 percent public offering valued at $62 million.
The airline was decalred bankrupt and closed in September 1994.
