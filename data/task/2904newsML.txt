MRS Technology Inc, encouraged by momentum in orders for a line of its printers, said Tuesday it plans to "soft pedal" its recent effort to court a merger partner.
The company cited two orders from U.S. semiconductor manufacturers for its recently introduced Model 5200GHR PanelPrinter in this year's fourth quarter.
Although it plans to ease away from courting a merger partner, the company said it will continue to consider forging relationships with two or more beta-site users for the company's new Model 70000 PanelPrinter.
