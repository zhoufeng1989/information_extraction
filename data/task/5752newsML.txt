Health Management Systems Inc said on Wednesday that it expects a third quarter charge of $5.5 million from the default of a major customer on its data processing agreement with the company.
Health Management said it has achieved "solid operating results" independent of the HHL Financial Services Inc default, which will hurt Health Management's earnings by $0.32 a share.
The company's third quarter ends July 30, 1996 and will be reported on September 4, 1996, Health Management said.  
Health Management said the charge is from an accounts receivable of $2.88 million, estimated costs relating to continued contractual obligations of HHL of $3.82 million and its investment of $927,000 in HHL.
The total pretax writeoff was $7.63 million and the company also reversed $2.18 million of third quarter revenues, Health Management said.
Except for the one-time charge, Health Management said it expects to meet its income targets for the fiscal year and the company believes it is fully reserved regarding any future exposure to HHL.  
Health Management chief financial officer Phillip Siegel said the charge will result in a "small" third quarter loss, he declined to give further details about the extent of the loss.
For the year ended October 1995, the company reported a profit of $9.7 million on sales of $86.7 million.
