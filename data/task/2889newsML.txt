T.A.L Investment Counsel Ltd said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Tuesday that it holds a 8.49 percent stake in Moore Corp Ltd, or 8,351,999 common shares.
T.A.L. disclosed its latest position on Moore in a 13G filing.
Filings under 13G are usually made by institutions and large investors with "passive" investment objectives in a company. Unlike 13D filings, those reports do not list the latest transactions.
