PageMart Wireless Inc said on Tuesday it launched a flat-rate service that allows subscribers to get customized financial information on their pagers.
The company said the service, infoQuotes, would alert subscribers when items in their personal investment portfolios move significantly or hit defined buy or sell parameters.
Subscribers would pay $15.95 per month for the basic service. They could use an interactive voice response system to define parameters and update specific indices they want to track, PageMart said.
