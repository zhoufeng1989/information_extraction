Kmart Corp shares traded up preceding Wednesday's market open on news of quarterly operating earnings that met Wall Street expectations.
Kmart stock was active at 10-7/8 early Wednesday, up 3/8 from Tuesday's New York Stock Exchange close.
The retailer said operating earnings for the second quarter ended July 31 were $0.07 per share, up from $0.05 in the year-ago period.
Revenues for the period slipped to $8.31 billion from $8.44 billion.  
Oracle Corp fell in pre-open trade as investors heeded Goldman Sachs's bearish remarks about the database management software company.
The stock fell to 37-1/4 from 39 after Goldman removed the issue from its priority list, though it remains on the recommended list, according to traders and a Goldman source.  
Rexene Corp extended a decline that began after yesterday's NYSE close when privately held Huntsman Corp dropped a $15 per share unsolicited bid for the company.
Without the bid, which totaled $460 million and had been sweetened from $14 a share, Rexene fell to 10-1/2, off from 12-3/4 at Tuesday's NYSE close and 1/8 under last night's after-hours decline, according to traders.
Intel Corp shares also weakened, slipping 1/2 to 79 on reports that company insiders were selling shares, traders said.
