Outdoor Systems Inc said Thursday it has completed its $710 million purchase of Gannett Co Inc's Outdoor Division, making Outdoor Systems the the largest outdoor advertising company in North America.
Outdoor Systems also exercised an option to buy Gannett's Outdoor operations in Houston, subject to obtaining applicable government approvals, said.
The acquisition is expected to boost Outdoor's sales to $400 million from $90 million.  It will now operate about 58,000 billboards, posters and transit displays in the United States and Canada and cover 22 major metropolitan markets.
