Centaur Mining & Exploration Ltd said it raised A$102 million through the placement of 60 million shares at A$1.70 each to Australian and international institutions.
The funds will be used for the Cawse nickel/cobalt project development and construction and other working capital requirements, chairman and managing director Joseph Gutnick said.
The placement is subject to shareholder approval at a meeting to be held around September 17, Gutnick said in a statement.  
The placement was jointly arranged by Bell Securities Ltd and Prudential-Bache Securities (Australia) Ltd, Gutnick said.
They will be paid a commission of 4.0 percent of total funds raised via the placement, he said.
The placement will increase Centaur's issued capital to 380.13 million shares. The placement price compared with Wednesday's closing market price of A$1.82.
Centaur said on August 6 that it expected to recoup its development costs of A$176 million for the Cawse nickel/cobalt project, which is in Western Australia, in the first two years of operation.  
The mine should come on stream in late 1997, initially producing around 8,400 tonnes of nickel and 2,000 tonnes of cobalt, Ken Hellsten, Centaur's general manager of operations, then told a metals conference in Melbourne.
Based on an average nickel price of US$3.50 a pound and a cobalt price of $12 a pound, the project is forecast to generate annual cash flow of between A$90 million and A$100 million in the first two years, Hellsten said.
He said cash operating costs of the mine would average $0.27 a pound, taking into account credits for cobalt.  
Over the first five years, Cawse is scheduled to produce an average of 8,400 tonnes of nickel and 1,400 tonnes of cobalt, annually, Hellsten said.
The resource could sustain an increase in production to between 30,000 and 35,000 tonnes per year of nickel and 2,500 tonnes per year of cobalt, he said.
"Once the plant is up and running ... we will look very seriously at that expansion, but clearly with the aim of keeping our cash costs down," Hellsten said.
