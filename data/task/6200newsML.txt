Test work near the main deposit of the proposed Yakabindie nickel project in Western Australia has identified an opportunity to lift projected recoveries, Dominion Mining Ltd said on Wednesday.
Testing of orebody samples has show that an immediate increase in recovery to around 67 percent from the design sign-off of 63.7 percent is likely to be achieved easily, Dominion said.
It is possible that concentrator recoveries in excess of 70 percent will be achievable on completion of further evaluation, the company said.  
A rise in recoveries would lower production costs of the project, Dominion said.
Most of the test results for earlier feasibility studies on the project worked to a flowsheet that suited smelter feed but did not optimise concentrator recovery, the company said.
"The downstream process developed for Yakabindie has significantly less demanding requirements for metals plant feed than a smelter," Dominion said.
Talks were taking place with selected groups about possible support for the project, it said.  
Dominion said in its June quarter report that Yakabindie could begin production by mid-1997, up to 12 months earlier than originally scheduled, and produce up to 30,000 tonnes per year of nickel metal by the end of calendar 1998 at a capital cost of A$540 million.
Fellow miner North Ltd decided in December last year not to take up an option which could have given it a stake of up to 80 percent in  the project.
