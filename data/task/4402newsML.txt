Danish biotech company Neurosearch gained 3.2 percent on the Copenhagen bourse on Tuesday after publishing a mixed first-half report.
At 1130 GMT the share -- which made its bourse debut at 235 crowns in June -- stood at 239.5, up 7.5 from Monday's close.
The firm announced first-half profits of 18 million crowns, compared to an 11.2 million crown loss in the same period last year, but added that the result was buoyed by one-off payments and that it expected a full year result similar to 1995's 4.5 million crowns. --Steve Weizman, Copenhagen newsroom +45 33969650.
