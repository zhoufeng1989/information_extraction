The Hong Kong government has shaved more than HK$1 billion off the amount Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd and Hutchison Whampoa Ltd should pay for development rights for a reclamation site in Hung Hom, the Hong Kong Standard newspaper said on Tuesday.
A company, equally owned by Cheung Kong and Hutchison, entered into a joint venture agreement with the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corp (KCRC) last December for the joint development of a commercial complex on the site.
The paper said a Lands Department official said the Hung Hom offer was "between HK$3 and HK$4 billion" and quoted an informed market source as saying the government had shaved more than HK$1 billion off the HK$4.5 billion it had previously asked for the site, the newspaper said.
Officials from Cheung Kong, Hutchison the KCRC and the government were not immediately available for comment.
The Standard said the KCRC was handling the negotiatings with the government, while Cheung Kong and Hutchison would pay the premium and all development costs.
The developers had three weeks to consider the offer, it said.
The project, to be completed in 1999, would generate a total gross floor area of more than 130,000 square metres.
It would comprise a 600-room hotel, three office towers, a shopping arcade, a cinena, car parks and other facilities, the paper said. -- Hong Kong Newsroom (852) 2843 6590
