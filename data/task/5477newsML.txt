Finnish telecommunications group Nokia Oy said in a statement on Wednesday the multimedia terminal output capacity of its new factory in Sweden would be about one million units per year.
"Nokia Multimedia Network Terminal's new factory will employ a staff of 300. The production capacity will be approximately one million 'd-boxes' per year and the factory will have space for further expansion," Nokia said.
The so called 'd-box' developed by Nokia is a device which turns a normal televisin set into a personal computer.  
"The TV can thus be used for receiving the growing number of digital satellite-TV programs as well as interactive services like home shopping, dataprograms, CD-ROM-services as sell as e-mail and telefax. The walls between entertainment, data-services and telecommunication have thus disappeared," Nokia said.
The new factory was opened on Wednesday in Motala, Sweden, Nokia said.
"The future global market for digital multimedia terminals is predicted to have an enormous growth potential where European technology will play a leading role," Nokia said.
An order won by Nokia last year for one million multimedia terminals to Beta-Technik, part of the German Kirch media group, was the largest single order so far for multimedia terminals in Europe, it said.
