Commercial BancShares Inc said on Wednesday it adopted a shareholder rights plan that takes effect only if a person or entity acquires or announces a tender offer for 10 percent or more of the company's stock.
The company said the plan was not being adopted in response to any specific threat to acquire control of the company.
