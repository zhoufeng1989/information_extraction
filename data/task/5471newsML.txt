Standard & Poor's said in a statement received here on Wednesday its upgrading to BBB plus from BBB of Merita Oy's unsecured long-term debt reflected the banking group's strong funding and improving asset quality.
"The rating action reflects the dominant position that Merita holds in the Finnish banking industry, its strong funding, and improving asset quality," S&P said.
Attaching a stable outlook to its new rating, S&P, however, said Merita's "ability to improve profitability is restrained by an economy that continues to be characterised by high structural unemployment and slack credit and consumer demand."
The bank's ability to "diversify ... income streams, while aggressively reducing a high cost base will be an important factor in improving the financial strength of Merita in the future," S&P said.
Many of the Finnish banking sector's problems of the early 1990s had now been resolved. "Asset-quality indicators are likely to continue to improve in the short term," it said.
But Merita would remain vulnerable to economic downturns, and S&P also said a "very competitive operating environment" would place downward pressure on margins. This would suppress efforts to strengthen profitability and capitalisation.
"Standard & Poor's continues to have concerns regarding asset concentration in the domestic economy," the credit rating institute said.
But as Merita was "very important to the ongoing payments system in Finland" the government would have a "strong incentive ... to stand behind the bank if a financial crisis occurred in the future," S&P said.
In its June 1996 KreditGuide report covering the Nordic countries, S&P said the outlook for Merita was stable.
"Although asset quality indicators have improved lately as the economy benefits from an export-led recovery, the amelioration in the creditworthiness of the new bank will likely proceed at a slower pace," the June report said.
