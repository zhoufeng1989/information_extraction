Ecuador has prohibited U.S. energy firm Maxus from further drilling for oil if it does not agree to rules on joint ventures with state-owned Petroecuador, Energy and Mines Minister Alfredo Adoum said.
"By order of the President of the Republic and by my order, Maxus will not extract another barrel of petroleum from Ecuadorean soil," Adoum told a news conference late Tuesday.
