London, Aug 20 - Chevron unit Gulf Oil cut crude oil throughput at its Milford Haven refinery following a problem at the weekend, a spokesman said on Tuesday.
A small leak was discovered in the crude furnace around 2200 GMT on Sunday.
Crude throughput was reduced from 115,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 100,000 bpd.
The furnace will be shut down and repaired but no decision has been made yet as to when this will happen.
It is not yet known how long it would take to bring the unit back up, the spokesman said.
Market sources estimated the shut down would take six to seven days.
Managers at the refinery were currently in a meeting discussing the problem, he added.
"The terminal is well stocked and we have enough in storage to cover a short shut-down," the spokesman said.
