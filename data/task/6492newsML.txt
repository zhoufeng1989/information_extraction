Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp's 1,200 megawatt nuclear power plant in Burlington, Kan., is operating at 100 percent of capacity after reducing power over the weekend for feedwater pump repairs, the company said.
"We completed the repairs, and we were back to 100 percent as of 0220 (CST/0320 EDT) this morning," spokeswoman Mona Grimsley said Wednesday.
Power output at the plant was reduced to 74 percent of capacity over the weekend for repairs to the "B" main feedwater pump.
The unit briefly reached 100 percent output late Monday, but power was again reduced to 55-60 percent of capacity to correct a problem with the "A" main feedwater pump.
Wolf Creek is 47 percent owned by Kansas City Power & Light Co, 47 percent by KGE, a Western Resources Inc subsidiary, and six percent by Kansas Electric Power Cooperative Inc.
