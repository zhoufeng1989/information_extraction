Cartonboard manufacturer Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG (MMK) said on Tuesday it expected an overall improvement in earnings this year compared to 1995, adding it would reinstate a dividend payment for 1996.
"Although the second half-year is normally weaker than the first, the foundations have been laid for an improvement in results for the year as a whole compared to the previous year," MMK said in a statement released before its news conference.
MMK said that group pre-tax profit in the first six months of this year slipped four percent to 371 million schillings.
For 1995, MMK reported a 17.8 percent rise in group pre-tax profit to 430 million schillings, but rattled investors by scrapping its dividend after paying out a 14 schilling dividend in 1994.
"A dividend will be paid on the financial year 1996," MMK said, without elaborating.
