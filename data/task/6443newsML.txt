USAir Group Inc's pilots backed the carrier's iniatiative to acquire routes to London's Heathrow Airport.
USAir filed today with the U.S. Department of Transportation for routes to Heathrow from Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Boston, and Charlotte.
The carrier cited the need for competition in the United States-United Kingdom market in view of the proposed alliance between British Airways Plc and AMR Corp's American Airlines.  
"USAir's pilots strongly support our company's aggressive stance toward expanding the airline's international reach," said Captain Bob Gaudioso, chairman of the Air Line Pilots Assocaition Master Executive Council at USAir.
"USAir's proposed routes to London Heathrow will increase competition and directly benefit the consumers and communities we serve," Gaudioso said.
