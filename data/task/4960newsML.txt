Continental Airlines said Wednesday it has launched a service on the Internet that will automatically send travelers information on fare discounts and other promotions via electronic mail.
Continental said the new service will give subscribers weekly updates on the special deals.
It said it would not charge a user fee for the service, called "Continental On Line Travel Specials".
Continental said customers can subscribe to the service through the table of contents at its World Wide Web site at http://www.flycontinental.com or in the third quadrant of its Web site entitled "Flying the Net".
The airline recently added its stock quote, which is updated every fifteen minutes, to its Web site, and plans to add flight and ticketing information later this year.
