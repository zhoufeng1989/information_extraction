Giant Industries Inc, a petroleum product refiner, said Thursday it has agreed to sell its exploration and production unit to privately held Central Resources for $25.5 million.
The deal is expected to close on August 30, Giant said.
Central Resources, based in Denver, will use the acquisition to help establish a solid exploration and production base in the southwestern United States, Giant said.
Giant will retain all natural gas properties that qualify for certain coal seam gas tax credits, and will keep the building in Farmington, N.M., that housed its unit.
