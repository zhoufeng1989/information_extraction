Building products and petroleum group Pioneer International Ltd said on Wednesday it expected to see a recovery in Australia's housing in the first half of calendar 1997.
"My view is we will see a recovery in the first half of 1997," managing director John Schubert told reporters.  
Schubert said he expected improving housing affordability, higher employment and wages would aid Australia's ailing housing industry.
"Most of these factors are going to lead to a recovery in the housing sector," he said.
The Australian government's budget changes to superannuation taxation for high income earners could also channel funds into the housing sector, Schubert said.
"(Housing) becomes one of the last remaining tax shelters," Schubert said.  
Schubert said Pioneer's building materials businesses worldwide had experienced a good start to the 1996/97 financial year in contrast to its petroleum refining and marketing joint venture, Ampol which was feeling the negative effects of low refiner margins for petroleum.
At 1.00 p.m. (300 GMT), Pioneer shares were one cent weaker at A$3.72.
