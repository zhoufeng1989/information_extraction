Licensees of the Troll West gas province are discussing the design and landfall for a new oil pipeline for the field, operator Statoil said in its Status Weekly newsletter on Thursday.
Statoil said a new line was required to supplement the exisitng Troll oil pipeline following plans for a Troll C platform to produce around 125,000 barrels per day (bpd) from mid-1999.
The existing pipeline, which runs to Mongstad near Bergen on the west coast, only has capacity to transport crude output from the Troll B platform at a rate of about 250,000 bpd.
A decision on the new transport solution may be taken by the end of the month, Statoil said.
Partners in the Troll development are Statoil, Norsk Hydro, Norske Shell, Elf Aquitaine, Saga Petroleum, DuPont's Conoco and Total.
