Sierra Leone has joined a regional scheme using aerial monitoring to help protect West African national fisheries from poaching by foreign vessels, a fisheries official said on Wednesday.
Naib Iscandri, deputy director fisheries at the marine resources ministry, told Reuters that the first flight across Sierra Leone's territorial waters took place on Tuesday.
The scheme, organised by a sub-regional commission on fisheries and funded by Luxembourg, groups Cape Verde, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania and Senegal, and now Sierra Leone.
"Sierra Leone is not a member of the sub-regional commission on fisheries but it is a member of the regional project for aerial monitoring of fishing zones," Iscandri said.
Fishing plays an important role in the economic life of coastal communities in West African states bordering the Atlantic Ocean and a major role in several national economies. Russian and Spanish fishermen have been accused of poaching.
Cape Verde, Mauritania and Senegal have each provided the commission with one plane for the job of monitoring.
"The use of planes for surveillance of the country's territorial waters will greatly reduce poaching which has almost crippled the country's fishing industry," Iscandi said.
