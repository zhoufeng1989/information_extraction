Canadian Bond Rating Service said on Thursday that it reaffirmed all the ratings of CT Financial Services Inc, after its agreement to sell First Federal Savings and Loan Assocation of Rochester.
The agency said the rating outlook for CT Financial is stable.
CT Financial, whose Canada Trust is a major player in Canada's banking industry, is 98 percent owned by Imasco Ltd, which is 41.5 percent owned by B.A.T Industries Plc.  
CT Financial said on Thursday it agreed to sell First Federal to Marine Midland Bank of Buffalo, which is owned by HSBC Holdings Plc, for more than C$935 million.
CBRS said the favourable ratings largely reflect the financial strengths of CT Financial's Canada Trust unit -- a strong market position in consumer banking, good profitability with relatively stable historical trend, excellent asset quality, strong capital levels and liquidity position and a well hedged balance sheet.
