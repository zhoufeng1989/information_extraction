Thistle Hotels Plc said on Tuesday that London would be the main target in the hotelier's expansion plans after it floats on the London stock market and launches its share offer in September.
The float is expected to value the company at between one billion and 1.5 billion stg. Of the 250 million stg in new cash raised under the offer, Thistle's chief executive Robert Peel told Reuters that around 100-150 million stg would be used to pay down debt, with the remaining 100 million invested in expanding its room capacity.
