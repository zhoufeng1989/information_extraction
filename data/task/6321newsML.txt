Yemen signed a memorandum of understanding with Britain's construction company Tarmac to upgrade the Aden refinery which was partly damaged during the 1994 civil war, an official said on Wednesday.
Tarmac "will now present a final financial and technical offer in the coming three months" to upgrade the 170,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery in the southern Yemeni port city of Aden, the oil ministry official told Reuters.
The some 40-year-old refinery, the only one in Yemen, has a current output of 100,000 bpd.
The official said Tarmac and National Westminster Bank Plc executives came to Yemen last week to discuss the project and sign the memorandum.
Impoverished Yemen, a newcomer to the elite club of Arab oil exporters, has a daily output of 350,000 bpd.
