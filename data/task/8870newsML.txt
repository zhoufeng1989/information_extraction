Lone Star Industries Inc said on Thursday it authorized a $15 million extension of the common stock buyback program that was started in November, 1995.
The initial authorization was for $20 million and $19 million of that has been spent, the company said. Lone Star said it is reviewing a refinancing plan that would provide fewer restrictions on the repurchase of its stock.
The company also said it approved the expansion of the slag cement grinding facility in New Orleans that would more than double the production capacity of the plant. The additional production should begin in the third quarter of 1997, the company said.
