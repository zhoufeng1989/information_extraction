Shares in Inco Ltd were up in heavy trading Wednesday morning on confirmation of a share buy-back and pending closure of its C$4.3-billion takeover of Diamond Fields Resources.
"Everything is going ahead," said mining analyst Doug Leishman at Yorkton Securities in Vancouver.
"They've got Voisey's Bay, and Inco's going to be a big company for a long, long time."
The stock rose C$0.75 to C$45.10 on the Toronto Stock Exchange in trading of 1.3 million shares. In New York, Inco's shares were up 5/8 to 32-7/8 in trading of 902,000 shares.  
"It's active because of the announcement that they're buying their stock back," said Joe Ismail at Maison Placements Canada Inc.
"People are taking opportunities because they know they can get a fixed price at this level here."
Inco said on Tuesday it would buy back 10 percent of its shares over the next year to offset earnings dilution stemming from its acquisition of Diamond Fields and its massive nickel-copper-cobalt deposit in Voisey's Bay, Labrador.  
The takeover is expected to close formally at 1600 EDT/2000 GMT on Wednesday barring any unforeseen problems, an Inco spokesman said.
The closing prompted Canadian Bond Rating Service to remove Inco from its credit watch list. Moody's said Wednesday it affirmed Inco's Baa2 senior debt rating.
