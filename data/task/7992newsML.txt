LONDON, Aug 22 (LPC) - Commerzbank AG and Natwest Markets have launched syndication of a five year, $100 million credit for Hungary's Central-European International Bank, the joint arrangers announced.
The fully underwritten credit is split into two equal tranches of $50 million, tranche one being a term loan and tranche two a revolving credit facility. Both are priced at 30 bps over LIBOR with a commitment fee of 15 bps.
The loans will be used in part to refinance two existing facilities -- a $50 million term loan from June 1994 and a $65 million term loan from April 1995 -- and also for general corporate purposes.
The borrower will achieve a substantial savings in interest due to the new deal, pricing having dropped dramatically for Hungarian borrowers in the last year since the state gained OECD membership. The 1995 credit was priced 80 bps over LIBOR with a five year maturity while the 1994 credit bears interest 87.5 bps over LIBOR for the same maturity.
CIB is Hungary's third largest bank in terms of capital and assets.
