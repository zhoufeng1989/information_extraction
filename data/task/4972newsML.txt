Trans World Airlines Inc. said Wednesday it named Edward Soule as executive vice president and chief financial officer.
He succeeds Robert Peiser, who left the company in June over differences in management direction, a TWA spokesman said.
Most recently, Soule served as chief financial officer of the St. Louis-based brokerage firm, Edward D. Jones & Co. Soule left Jones in 1995 to study at Washington University.
