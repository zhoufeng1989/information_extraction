Heavylift Volgadnepr Airlines said it will be operating three Antonov 124 charter flights between Chateauroux and Ulyanovsk early next month carrying vehicles taking part in the Paris-Moscow-Peking Master rally.
"Three flights are scheduled for September 7 and 8, with approximately 40 jeep-type vehicles, 10 trucks and between 20 and 30 motorcycles being shipped," a Heavylift official told Reuters.
The AN-124 aircraft can carry up to 150 tonnes and the Chateauroux-Ulyanovsk charters will also transport helicopters to be used in the television coverage of the rally and broadcasting equipment, the official added.
The rally will start at the Trocadero -- near the Eiffel Tower in Paris -- where the vehicles and motorcyles in competition will undergo techincal check-ups before travelling down to Chateauroux to take part in a prologue event at the airport, a Chateauroux airport authority official said.
"The rally's organisers were impressed by the uncongested facilities at the airport coupled with the length of the runway, a package which enabled us to beat off competition from the Paris airports, Lyon and Marseille," he said.
