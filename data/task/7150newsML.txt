French chemical group Rhone-Poulenc SA said its Fibres and Polymers division was taking full control of Kermel from August 31.
Kermel, which markets a thermostable metaramide-type fibre used in making flame- and heat-resistant garments, had been a joint-venture between Rhone-Poulenc and Amoco since 1992.
Rhone-Poulenc gave no financial details of the transaction.
Amoco no longer considered the unit part of its strategic objectives.
Kelmer is located in Colmar, France, and employs 67 people with annual sales of 95 million francs.
