Taiwan's shipping stocks jumped in early Wednesday trade as shippers jostled to take advantage of new Chinese rules on direct shipping links with Taiwan.
After one hour of trade, Yang Ming Marine was the most active issue, soaring T$2.0 or 5.56 percent to T$38.0. Yang Ming said on Wednesday it had signed a joint slot exchange agreement with China's China Ocean Shipping Global Co.
The agreement would allow Yang Ming to cover trade between North Europe and Japan, China and Asia.
Shipping giant Evergreen Marine was the second most active issue, rising T$1.9 or 4.09 percent to T$48.4.  
Uniglory Marine advanced T$2.5 or 5.29 percent to T$49.8, also in active trade.
"Investors have been waiting for direct shipping links for a long time and now they find a chance to buy shipping stocks," said Wang Jieh of Foremost Investment.
Taiwanese officials' comments in the past few days that there would be no change in the island's economic policy toward China also helped sentiment, brokers said.
