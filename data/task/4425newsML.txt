Austrian oil and chemicals group OMV AG said on Tuesday its forecast for flat full-year earnings was based on a conservative outlook for polyolefins in the fourth quarter.
Finance director Wolfgang Ruttenstorfer told a news conference that polyolefin prices in the first half were already well below year-ago levels, squeezing refining and plastics margins.
He forecast worse was to come in the fourth quarter.
"We expect to match our 1995 result, allowing for a significant deterioration in polyolefins in the fourth quarter," Ruttenstorfer said.
"If the downturn does not happen there will be room to improve our full-year result," he added.
In 1995, OMV posted a record pre-tax profit of 2.09 billion schillings and earnings before interest and tax of 2.19 billion.
Ruttenstorfer estimated polyolefin revenues were down by about one billion schillings in the first half of 1996.
"We have undertaken a range of measures to compensate...cutting costs and increasing sales volume by 23 percent," he said. -- Janet McBride, Vienna Newsroom 43-1-531 12 254
