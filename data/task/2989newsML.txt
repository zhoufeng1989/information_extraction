U.S. Surgical Corp said Tuesday the federal government has raised no objections about its $18 cash tender offer for all outstanding common shares of Circon Corp.
It said the waiting period during which the government could review the proposed merger and raise antitrust concerns had expired.
The offer expires August 29, unless extended.
