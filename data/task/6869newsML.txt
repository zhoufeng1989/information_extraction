USAir Group Inc said on Wednesday it has filed with the Department of Transportation to serve London's Heathrow Airport from Boston, Charlotte, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.
The airline cited the need for competition in the United States-United Kingdom market in view of the proposed alliance between British Airways Plc and AMR Corp's American Airlines.
