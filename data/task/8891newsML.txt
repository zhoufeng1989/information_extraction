Both R&G Financial Corp and Transact Technologies Inc went public on Wednesday in successful initial public offerings by small underwriters.
Shares of R&G were up 2-5/8 to 17-1/8 in afternoon trading. The two million shares priced at $14.50 each for the IPO, which was underwritten by Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co. The estimated pricing range had been $13 to $15.
R&G, the holding company for Puerto Rico mortgage banking company R&G Mortgage Corp, had assets of $868.3 million at March 31, 1996.  
Transact also made its market debut, with shares moving up 1/4 to 8-3/4 from its IPO price of $8.50 a share. The shares priced below the estimated range of $9.50 to $11 a share. Cruttenden Roth was the lead underwriter of the deal.  
TransAct was formerly a subsidiary of Tridex Corp, which now owns 5.4 million of the 6.55 million TransAct shares outstanding, or about 82 percent.
TransAct said it would use net proceeds of about $9 million from the IPO to repay debt to Tridex, for working capital and for general corporate purposes.
The company was formed through the combination of Tridex's Magnetec Corp and Ithaca Peripherals subsidiaries.
TransAct makes transaction-based printers and related products for the point-of-sale, gaming and lottery, financial services and kiosk markets.
