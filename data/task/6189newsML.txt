SYDNEY, Aug 22 - Moody's Investors Service said it confirmed the long term ratings of Electricity Corp of New Zealand, affecting about US$900 million of debt.  
The ratings agency said it confirmed the long term credit rating of AA3 and the short term debt rating of Prime 1.
It said the confirmation concluded a review which began in June last year in response to the New Zealand government's stated intention to split the corporation into two competing state-owned enterprises, which occurred on February 1 this year.
It said the short term rating was not under review.
