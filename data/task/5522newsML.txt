Right Start Inc said on Wednesday it does not expect to report profits within the near term due recent investments in its business.
"Due to significant long-term investment that we have made in human resources and infrastructure, we do not expect to be profitable in the near term," the company said in a statement.
The company sells clothes for infants and children up to age four. It had been a catalog company up until fiscal 1996, which ended June 1, when it began to open retail stores.
Earlier, the company reported a fiscal fourth quarter loss of $0.34 a share versus a loss of $0.01 a share one year ago.
Right Start did not say exactly what the near term was in its loss forecast and company officials were not available to comment.
