Inco Ltd was down slighty on heavy volume in the first hours of trading Thursday, as investors shifted their positions after the closing of the Diamond Fields Resources takeover.
Inco's stock was down C$0.85 to C$44.90 in trading of 780,000 shares. In New York, the shares were unchanged at 32-3/4 in trading of 498,000.
"All of a sudden you've got a lot more shares and people are probably flipping it," said mining analyst Bruce Reid with Yorkton Securities.  
On Wednesday, Inco finally closed its C$4.3-billion takeover of Diamond Fields and its massive nickel resources at Voisey's Bay, Labrador.
Inco has created a new class of shares to allow Diamond Fields shareholders to participate directly in the profits of the deposit.
Some Inco shareholders may still fear earnings dilution because of the takeover, but most of them have already sold their stock, Reid said.
