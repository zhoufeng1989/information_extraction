Shares in Banco Portugues de Investimento (BPI) jumped on Lisbon bourse after news it was the only candidate in the privatisation of Banco de Fomento & Exterior (BFE) approved by the jury, dealers said.
"The price jumped because the news that there was only one accepted bidder should mean that it will be cheaper to buy BFE," said one analyst, who asked not to be identified.
Three candidates -- BPI, Banco Finantia and Banco Nacional de Credito Imobiliario -- had lodged bids to buy BFE.
BPI shares rose to a high for the year of 2,102 escudos, up 92 escudos, in volume of 125,516 shares.  
The price offered by BPI for BFE was not immediately known.
BPI was the only candidate for the state's 65 percent stake in BFE whose bid was approved by the selection jury, Finance Minister Antonio Sousa Franco told a news conference.
Shares in BFE were suspended on Thursday at 2,545 escudos ($16.6) ahead of the news conference.
Shares in cement group Cimpor-Cimentos de Portugal, which has an 11.06 percent stake in BFE, were down 40 escudos at 3,350 escudos 1353 GMT.
