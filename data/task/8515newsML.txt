Canada's Trizec Corporation and Granit Polus Rt, registered in Hungary, will set up a joint venture for $3 billion in real estate development, mostly in eastern Europe, Granit Polus said on Thursday.
Granit Polus chairman Sandor Demjan told a news conference that the projects would include the construction of shopping malls, modern office buildings and industrial parks.
Trizec, one of North America's largest real estate developers, belongs to the Horsham holding controlled by Peter Munk, who also holds a stake in Granit Polus. Andrew Sarlos, also a Hungarian-Canadian businessman, has an interest in Granit Polus.
The joint venture will be equally owned by Granit Polus and Trizec, and its general director will be Ferenc Bartha, Hungary's former chief privatisator.
Demjan said Granit Polus will open its first shopping mall, the 52,000 sq metre Polus centre on the outskirts of Budapest, formerly the site of a Soviet military base, on November 8, following just 10 months of construction.
"This (rapidness) will be a world record," Demjan said.
In European countries in transition from communist-type systems, shopping malls account for a small portion of retail sales, compared with some 50 percent in Western Europe and 70 percent in the U.S.
