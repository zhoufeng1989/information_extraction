Operations at Saudi Arabia's second largest export refinery at Jubail should return to normal on Wednesday following a small fire at the refinery's hydro-cracking unit, a company official said on Tuesday.
"We had a small fire (on Saturday) but it didn't disturb exports. We had naphtha in our tanks and we used our stocks. We will resume operations tomorrow," he told Reuters.
The Jubail refinery will shut down in November for 30 days of scheduled maintenance to change the catalyst used at the plant's main hydrocracking unit.
The official said the company used the fire as an opportunity to inspect the unit ahead of the November work.
Jubail is jointly operated by Saudi Aramco and Royal Dutch/Shell Group.
