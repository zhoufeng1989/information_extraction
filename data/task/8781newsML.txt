Carbide/Graphite Group Inc said Thursday expenses due to downtime at its Seadrift needle coke facility will reduce first quarter net income by about $1 million.
The Seadrift facility, which is closed for maintenance approximately two weeks every two to three years, remained closed for an extra week as maintenance and capital projects took longer to implement.
Carbide/Graphite is a leading manufacturer of industrial graphite and calcium carbide products.
