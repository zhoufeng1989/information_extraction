Genetically-engineered plant varieties currently under test will change the face of the sugar industry within five years, an Australian biotechnologist said on Wednesday.
"Current (gene) technology will profoundly change the face of the sugar industry," Robert Birch, head of the University of Queensland's biotechnology department, told the Sugar 2000 conference here.
The new technology to produce transgenic sugarcane only emerged in 1992 and new plant varieties would be in Australian cane fields by 2000, Birch said.  
"All future sugar varieties will be transgenic and may well change the competitive efficiencies between sugar-producing countries," Birch said.
He said varieties of genetically modified plants currently under investigation were to control cane grub and leaf scald.
Factors limiting sucrose accumulation in sugar cane could also now be investigated as well as genes to reduce flowering and fibre accumulation in cane varieties.
Controlling maturation of cane varieties also could now be achieved "to allow sugar cane to mature on cue," Birch said.  
"Our capacity to introduce new genes into sugar cane plants no longer limits our ability to use transgenic sugar cane," Birch said.
He said more than 1,000 agricultural plant field trials were being conducted worldwide with sugar cane only one of many varieties.
"None of these field trials has shown any harmful or hazardous or unexpected behaviour," he said.
"As a result public perceptions are becoming more positive towards transgenic plant material," Birch said.  
Birch warned that new gene technologies were eligible for patent protection allowing control of the technology for at least 20 years by the patent owners.
"(Sugar) industries must therefore consider whether to participate as creators of key technologies which they will need to access for continued profitability," he said.
