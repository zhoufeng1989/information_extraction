Dutch technical engineering group Stork NV said on Wednesday it knew about takeover talks between Samsung Aerospace and the receivers of bankrupt planemaker Fokker NV, but that it did not plan to sell Fokker Aviation to the South Korean company.
"(In the negotiations) there is specifically no question of Stork selling back Fokker Aviation. The point of departure is that there is close and constructive cooperation between the parties (Samsung and Stork)," Stork said in a statement.
In July Stork bought the profitable maintenance and services arms of Fokker, Fokker Aviation.
Samsung on the other hand is in talks about buying the bankrupt plane manufacturing bits of Fokker.
Stork agreed to ultimately sell back Fokker Aviation to a buyer of the planemaking activities if this were necessary to the bankrupt firm's survival.
