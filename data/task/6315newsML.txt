Yemen's cabinet on Wednesday approved amendments to an oil production-sharing agreement with Nimir Petroleum of Saudi Arabia, Sanaa radio reported.
It gave no details, but an oil industry source said the amendments "aim to encourage this company and other firms to increase their exploration in Yemen and raise production levels."
Nimir produces between 8,000 and 10,000 barrels per day (bpd) from Yemen's Shabwa region.
Impoverished Yemen, a newcomer to the elite club of Arab oil exporters, produces a total of 350,000 bpd.
