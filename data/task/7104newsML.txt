Finnish shipping company Birka Line Ab said in a statement on Wednesday it had agreed to sell its m/s Golden Princess vessel to  Superstar Capricorn Limited, part of Malaysian  Star Cruise.
Birka said the sale, which would take place at market price, would have a negative impact on 1996 results but the company still expects to show a profit for the year.
It did not give the value of the deal.
