BASF AG, the German chemicals company, said on Wednesday it saw no regulatory obstacles that could block it planned sale of a 51 percent stake in German potash group Kali und Salz AG to a Canadian company.
"We are convinced that the anti-trust question can be resolved," BASF's executive chairman Juergen Strube said.
His remarks come after the German cartel office said last week that it had some reservations over the planned deal with Canada's Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (PCS).
The office said the worries stemmed from the fact both Kali and PCS have a large share of the fertiliser market.
But Strube played down the fears by saying both firms were strong in different geographical areas, while there were also strong other potash companies in the former Soviet Union, Jordan and Israel.
"This is a higthly competitive business," said Strube.
BASF currently holds 76 percent of loss-making Kali und Salz.
