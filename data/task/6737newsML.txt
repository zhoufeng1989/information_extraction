Shares in Zeneca Group climbed on Wednesday as talk of a possible bid for the company resurfaced, traders said.
But many were sceptical about whether the rumours contained any more substance than in the past.
"It's the same old stories and the same old names but the stock is so illiquid that people can move them up without anyone standing in the way," said one trader.
By 0804 GMT, the shares were up 16p at 15.19 stg, after earlier touching a record high of 15.23 stg. Trading volume was a modest 406,000.  
The weekend press reignited the bid speculation with Swiss company Roche mentioned as one possible predator.
