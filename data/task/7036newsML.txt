The Allen Group Inc said its subsidiary MARTA Technologies Inc had lost a contract with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency for centralized automobile emissions testing in the Cincinnati area.
In a statement late on Tuesday, the company said the contract was worth about $11 million a year in revenues to MARTA.
MARTA had received a cancellation notice from the agency that was effective Aug 27. The agency also suspended MARTA's operations under the program effective on Wednesday.
The agency cited "alleged problems" for termination of the contract, Allen Group said.
"We strongly disagree with the state of Ohio's ... decision to cancel MARTA's contract," said Allen Group president and chief executive Robert Paul.
