UTC International AG and  Basler Handels-Gesellschaft (BHG) said they have decided to sell a majority stake in Jelmoli Holding AG.
UTC has 50.3 percent of the voting rights of Jelmoli. Its capital stake is just less than 42 percent. UTC is a Basle-based private company. Its owners comprise roughly 200 shareholders, mostly long-time Basle families. BHG is the holding company of UTC.
Jelmoli, a diversified Swiss retail group, has lately undergone an extensive restructuring which includes sale of most of its department stores.
UTC said in a letter to shareholders that it has appointed Credit Suisse to complete the sale. It said that Swiss investor Walter Fust had made a limited-time offer for the stake and this offer was also being evaluated by Credit Suisse.
The sale was aimed at strengthening UTC's international business and reducing its external debt, it said. -- Zurich Editorial, +41 1 631 7340
