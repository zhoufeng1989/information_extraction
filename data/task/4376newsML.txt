Shares in Axa firmed but failed to keep pace with the CAC-40 index after a 24.5 percent increase in the insurance group's turnover for the first half.
At 1251 GMT the shares were up 2.7 francs or 0.95 percent at 286.3 francs. The CAC-40 index, in which Axa is weighted at 3.49 percent, was up 1.45 percent at 2,014.92.
Axa reported first-half turnover of 81.93 billion francs compared with 65,81 billion francs in the same period of 1995.
It said the increase primarily reflected the consolidation of Australian insurer National Mutual.
On a like-for-like basis turnover grew 8.8 percent.  
Mid-session volume of some 25,000 shares made Axa the tenth most active stock on the Paris bourse.
Brokers took on board the strong special factors surrounding consolidation in Axa's figures but said the underlying picture looked sound.
Some were surprised at the share's weakness in relation both to the market and to insurer UAP -- up 1.37 percent.
"Among the good factors is growth in life assurance," said Sami Gotrane of brokers EIFB. "Much of that is NatMut but it was also up 16 percent in Europe where there was no acquisition and up 12 percent in France...," he said.
