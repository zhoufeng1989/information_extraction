Shares in semiconductor maker Austria Mikro Systeme International AG (AMS) fell almost 11 percent to a new year low in Vienna on Wednesday in a continuing reaction to disappointing half-year results.
At 1113 GMT AMS stood 77 schillings down at 670 schillings, having touched a session low of 666. AMS was also the market's top loser on Tuesday when it closed 5.32 percent down.
"Investors are reevaluating the stock. Sentiment is still negative and there are plenty of sellers to take out the few buyers," a floor trader said.
On Tuesday AMS reported a first half group pre-tax loss of 3.1 million schillings and said its performance was unlikely to improve in the second half.
Analysts said they planned to cut their full-year estimates.
"Most Austrian banks are revising their forecasts down. People who bought at 800 schillings as a long-term investment are obviously disappointed," another trader said. -- Vienna Newsroom, 43-1-53112-258
