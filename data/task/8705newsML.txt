Maxus Energy Corp, a unit of Argentina's YPF SA, said an earlier statement Thursday afternoon by Petroecuador that it and Maxus had reached agreement on an oil operations contract dispute was premature.
"I would suggest to you that headline is premature, and the situation is still developing," said Scott Jones, an executive with Maxus in Dallas, referring to the Petroecuador statement.  
Late Tuesday in Quito, the country's energy and mines minister Alfredo Adoum ordered the halting of Maxus oil production in the country.
The government said it was banning Maxus from continuing its operations in Ecuador until it reaches a joint venture deal with Petroecuador.
Maxus is the only one of the 10 or so foreign oil companies producing Ecuadoran oil which does not have a production-sharing agreement with the government. Maxus has been engaged in negotiations over new contract terms.
"We will have a definitive comment on the issue in the morning," Jones said. He did not elaborate.
Earlier Thursday, Petroecuador said Maxus had agreed to alter contracts to run its Ecuadoran oil operations as a joint venture with the state-owned firm.
