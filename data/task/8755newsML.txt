A group led by TCW Group said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Thursday it holds an 11.1 percent stake in Kellstrom Industries or 342,100 common shares.
The group disclosed its latest position on Kellstrom in a 13G filing.
Filings under 13G are usually made by institutions and large investors with "passive" investment objectives in a company. Unlike 13D filings, those reports do not list the latest transactions.
