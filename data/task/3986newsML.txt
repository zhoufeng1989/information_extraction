London, Aug 20 - Chevron unit Gulf Oil will close their crude furnace at the U.K. Milford Haven refinery on Wednesday, for a maximum six days, a spokesman said on Tuesday.
A small leak was discovered in the crude furnace around 2200 GMT on Sunday. Inspection and repair of the hole will take 24-36 hours.
Crude throughput has been reduced since then from 115,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 100,000 bpd.
"The terminal is well stocked and we have enough in storage to cover a short shut-down," the spokesman said.
