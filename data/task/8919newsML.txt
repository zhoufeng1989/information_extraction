Florida Power Corp's (FPC) 825 megawatt (MW) Crystal River 3 nuclear generating unit will reach 100 percent power today after output was scaled back late Tuesday, the company said Thursday.
"We expect to be 100 percent this morning," said company spokeswoman Melodie Hendrix.
The utility reduced the plant's power output to 60 percent of capacity to correct a condensate pump problem.
The utility earlier said the unit would likely resume full service late Wednesday, but Hendrix said more cleaning needed for the pump pushed back the unit's return to full output.
Crystal River 3 produces 15 percent of the electricity FPC delivers in its Florida service territory.
FPC, a subsidiary of Florida Progress Corp, is the operator and major owner of the Crystal River 3. Ten Florida municipal utilities own the remaining interests in the unit.
The Crystal River facility, in Red Level, Fla., also has four fossil-fuel units, with a combined capacity of 2,276 MW.
