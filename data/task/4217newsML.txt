Intimate Brands Inc said Tuesday it was on target to open about 300 new stores or 800,000 square feet of new retail space this year.
Intimate Brands said it had opened 142 stores and made expansions totaling 407,000 square feet of selling space to date this year.
It said its chain store Victoria's Secret would increase its share of the international catalogue market in 1996 by expanding circulation in Canada and Japan.
