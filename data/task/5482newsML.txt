Finnish information technology group TT Tieto Oy said in a statement on Wednesday it would merge the operations of its two subsidiaries Unic Oy and TT-Personnel Systems Oy.
The two operations would move to Unic's facilities in Leppavaara, Espoo and the new company would continue operating under the Unic Oy name, it said.
"Thus an important centre of knowledge will be created, which the Software Services division's regional offices complement and support well," it said.
