Talbots Inc said on Tuesday there was "unexpected" softening of sales during the last two weeks of July.
"Had this softening occurred earlier in the quarter, we could have reacted further from the expense side to more fully protect earnings for the quarter," said Arnold Zetcher, chief executive officer, in a press release.
Talbots said that while readings from its early fall catalog allow the company to remain "hopeful", it continues to be cautious.
Talbots reported earnings for the second quarter ended August 3 of $0.20 a share down from $0.24 a share the previous second quarter.
Second quarter net sales were $232.1 million up from $226.9 million. Comparable store sales fell 4.9 percent.
The company also said that it is on track to open 75 new stores by the end of fiscal 1996, for a total of 535 stores worldwide.
