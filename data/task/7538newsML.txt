German food retail group AVA Allgemeine Handelsgesellschaft der Verbraucher AG said on Wednesday it expected a clear rise in 1996 profit due to a fall in tax payments.
Pre-tax profit fell 27 percent to 22 million marks in the first six months while group sales, excluding its 40 percent owned Stuttgart-based affiliate Nanz, rose by 4.8 percent to 4.3 billion marks,  AVA said in a statement.  
On a same-store basis, group sales rose 1.4 percent, AVA said. The company said the first-half earnings decline was caused by start-up costs for new sites.
