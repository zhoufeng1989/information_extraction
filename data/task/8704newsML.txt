Seagate Technology's Seagate Software said on Thursday it launched Seagate ExecView, touting it as the first solution that provides integrated, cross-platform storage management for enterprise networks running Microsoft Windows NT and Novell NetWare operating systems.
Loaded on either a Windows NT server or a Windows 95 client, ExecView provides administrators with information on all Seagate Backup Exec for Windows NT and Seagate Backup Exec for NetWare operations from a single administrator console, the company said.
ExecView initially will be released in English and is expected to be available in August at an suggested retail price of $1,395 for 5 servers, $3,595 for 20 servers and $5,595 for 50 servers, the company said.
With ExecView, administrators can monitor all scheduled, active and completed backup operations to ensure compliance with company data protection standards and identify backup operations that need attention, the company said.
French, German and Spanish versions are expected to be available in September, the company said.
