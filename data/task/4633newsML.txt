Singapore expects more than 1 billion shares of Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (SingTel) to be involved in the company's second public tranche, Singapore Commissioner of the Inland Revenue Koh Yong Guan said on Tuesday.
He said the government expected "something more than...1,000 million shares" to be involved in the public offer of shares in telephone monopoly SingTel.
He said the offer launch date would be August 21 and the closing date would be September 13.  
Koh, who is in charge of the government committee organising the sale, said at a media briefing the shares would be credited into the accounts of successful applicants by September 17.
Asked by reporters if that was the date shares would be tradeable, he said: "Yes, that will be the day."
A statement distributed at the briefing estimated the price-earnings ratio for the new offer shares would be 25.6 times, based on the discounted price of Singapore $2.50 per share and the company's net earnings per share of 9.75 cents for the financial year ended March 31, 1996.
