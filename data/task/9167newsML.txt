Hungarian oil company MOL and the Austrian power company EVN will jointly build a power station in the city of Nagykanizsa (SW Hungary), Hungarian news agency MTI reported on Thursday.
The power station, which will utilise combined gas and steam technology, will have a capacity of 80 megawatts and will produce 600 gigawatt/hours of power per year. Construction will cost approximately 1.2 billion schillings.
The power station will be jointly owned by EVN, MOL and Stojan International, a Vienna based engineering consulting and trading house. The Stojan stake will later be taken over by EVN, making EVN the majority stakeholder.
The turbine will burn low heat-value gas from nearby wells at the villages of Inke and Liszo, supplemented with higher grade gas, thus tapping otherwise unusable resources, MTI said.
A spokesman for EVN said the station should be ready in 1999 or 2000.
