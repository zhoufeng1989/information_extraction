Fletcher Challenge Ltd chief executive Hugh Fletcher on Wednesday said FCL Forest Division had received three unsolicited offers for its 20,000 hectare Hikurangi forest in New Zealand's North Island.
He said he expected the company to cover the cost of the purchase of state-owned Forestry Corporation and the purchase of the $100 million solid wood processing assets of Fletcher Building from the sales of forests.  
Fletcher Forest leads a consortium with Brierley Investments Ltd and China's Citic which is buying Forestry Corporation for NZ$2.026 billion. Its equity share is NZ$240 million.
Fletcher said the company should realise "several hundred million dollars" from the forest sales, but would be interested in swapping forest to create contiguous blocks.
Answering questions about the tax position of Fletcher Forest, he said with about $300 million of tax losses available, Fletcher Forest would have a tax liability but the bulk of it would be deferred.  
"Somewhere out there in the future, Forests has significant cash paying liability," Fletcher said.
The contract for managing the Forestry Corp assets had the potential to return between nil and $20 million, Fletcher said.
He said the deal would "improve the prospects of Fletcher Forest paying a dividend" but noted that like Fletcher Energy the stock tended to be attractive for capital gain rather than its dividend stream.  
He said there was no transfer of value between the forest and paper division as a result of the cancellation of the government's obligations under a long term supply contract between Forestry Corp and FCL's Tasman subsidiary. The board had been careful to ensure Fletcher Paper was receiving fair compensation. -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 473-4746
