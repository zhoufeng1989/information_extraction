Tracor Inc said on Monday that its Vitro Corp subsidiary has been awarded a special designation by the Software Engineering Institute.
Vitro Corp was given a Level 3 designation out of five levels. The company said only 10 percent of software companies have implemented a standard software process to gain the Level 3 recognition.
The designation was offered after a six-member team, headed by the Software Productivity Consortium, reviewed Vitro's procedures and project documents, and interviewed employees.
