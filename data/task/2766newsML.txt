- Electricity spot prices will decline by 11 percent by 1999 and then stabilize at around $27.50 megawatts/hour, the firm said. That is 30 percent lower than the contractual prices both Central Puerto and Central Costanera currently enjoy.
- As a result, Central Puerto faces profit declines of 66 percent in 2000 and 48 percent in 2001, while Central Costanera's profits will likely fall 58 percent and 67 percent in those years, Paribas said.
