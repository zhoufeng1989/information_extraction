ML Bancorp Inc said it would record about $3.8 million of additional earnings, or $0.32 per fully diluted share, during the quarter ending Sept 30, 1996.
The company said in a statement late on Wednesday that the extra earnings would be caused by the presidential signing of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996.
The act finalized the non-taxability of base year tax bad debt reserves -- reserves established before Jan 1, 1988 -- and resolved the treatment of tax bad debt reserves taken in excess of the base year amount. They will now be recaptured as taxable income over a six-year period.
The company had established a deferred tax liability during its fiscal year ended March 31, 1994, related to the base year bad debt reserves in anticipation of changing the Bank's charter to that of a commercial bank. The $3.8 million of income to be recognized represents the reversal of such liability.
The company has an existing deferred tax liability for the recapture of the excess tax bad debt reserves.
