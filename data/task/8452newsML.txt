Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap AS (Statoil) said on Thursday it plans to shoot more than 200,000 kms of three-dimension seismic lines in 1996 on acreage operated by the group, setting a new record for the company.
Costed at about 200 million crowns for the year, the work includes operations on the North Sea Gullfaks field, which is undergoing a resurvey of the main field and all satellites, the company's Status Weekly newsletter said.
Surveying has also begun on the Connemara prospect off west Ireland and work will begin this month on block 6710/10 in the Nordland VI area off mid-Norway.
"Surveys completed so far in 1996 include the area on and around the Siri field, both in Danish waters and on Norway's side of the median line," said Karin Ask, manager of geophysical operations in Statoil's exploration technology unit.
"We've also finished surveying the Vena area in the Norwegian Sea, on blocks 6706/11 and 6706/12 awarded in the 15th round."
Seismic data have become increasingly important in the search for hydrcarbons and new technology had made it possible to extract several types of information from survey results, Ask said.
