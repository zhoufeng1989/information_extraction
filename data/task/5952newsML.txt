Russia's AO Aviastar aircraft manufacturer has suspended production because its power supplies have been cut off as the company has not payed its electricity bills, a company source said on Wednesday.
"All staff (about 28,000 workers) have been sent on holiday until September," the official, who declined to be named, told Reuters by telephone from the central Russian city of Ulyanovsk.
Interfax news agency said Aviastar's debts for electricity were 130 billion roubles, and management planned to cut staff numbers next month.
There was no official comment from the company.
The shut-down at Aviastar, which manufactures both cargo and passenger planes, follows agreement earlier this month to set up a Taiwan subsidiary, Aviastar Asia Corp, to market and service Tupolev Tu-204 jets in South-East Asia.
Aviastar commercial director Nikolai Kachalov said Aviastar had invested $250,000 in the new company out of its total capital of $10 million.
Japanese companies Tomen Corporation and Yamaichi Securities Company Ltd were also involved in the project as well as several Taiwan firms.
Kachalov said Aviastar currently had 680 options for Tu-204 passenger and cargo aircraft from companies in Britain, Bulgaria, Switzerland, Poland, Iran and the Commonwealth of Independent States.
