Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) July production dropped to 23,965 tonnes from 29,819 tonnes in June due to a fire which closed down one of its two smelters last month.  
Cobalt production also dropped to 259 tonnes from 457 tonnes in June as a result of the previously announced fire at ZCCM's Mufulira smelter.
The smelter -- which produces between 450 and 500 tonnes of a copper a day -- was now fully operational, a company spokesman said.  
"During the rehabilitation of the smelter, the company registered a shortfall in primary copper production of 5,022 tonnes from the Mufulira smelter," the spokesman said.
He added that the company expected to make up the shortfall during the current financial year.
Production of copper and cobalt had been steadily rising since September 1995, when production reached a trough of 19,554 and 165 tonnes.
