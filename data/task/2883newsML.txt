CNA Financial Corp said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing Tuesday that it held a 9.9 percent stake in LaSalle Re Holdings Ltd, or 1,425,354 common shares.
The group disclosed its latest position on LaSalle in a 13G filing. As of August 7, the outstanding totalled 14,397,000 common shares.
Filings under 13G are usually made by institutions and large investors with "passive" investment objectives in a company. Unlike 13D filings, those reports do not list the latest transactions.
