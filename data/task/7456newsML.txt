Japan National Railway (JNR) Settlement Corp may auction 100,000 fewer West Japan Railway Co (JR West) shares than the 750,000 it had been planning, due to a lack of investor interest, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper said on Wednesday.
The mass-circulation daily said JNR was likely to offer the leftover shares in the next fiscal year.
JNR officials were not immediately available for comment.
The firm has said it would sell 1.7 million JR West shares, 750,000 of them via an auction.  
The applications, made through securities houses, closed on August 8 and 13 and buyers will be chosen on August 27, it said. The share price will be determined on August 29.
JR West is one of the seven firms in the JR group, which was formed from the privatisation of the former state-owned Japanese National Railways.
