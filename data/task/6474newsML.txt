Florida Power Corp's (FPC) 825 megawatt (MW) Crystal River 3 nuclear power station is expected to resume full output after production was reduced late Tuesday, the company said Wednesday.
"They started the pump back at 1100 EDT," said FPC spokeswoman Melodie Hendrix. "If all goes well, we'll start returning to (full) power at 1500 EDT."
The utility scaled back the operation of the unit to about 60 percent of capacity to correct a condensate pump problem.
Hendrix added it would take four to six hours for the plant to ramp up to full service.
Crystal River 3 produces 15 percent of FPC's electricity deliveries in its Florida service territory, Hendrix said.
FPC, a subsidiary of Florida Progress Corp, is the operator and major owner of the Crystal River 3.
The Crystal River facility is located in Red Level, Fla.
