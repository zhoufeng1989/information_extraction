Austrian oil and chemicals group OMV AG said on Tuesday it planned to reduce the number of gasoline stations it operates in Austria over the next three years while expanding its network in neighbouring countries.
OMV operates 284 filling stations in Germany, Slovenia, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, northern Italy and Croatia. In Austria it has 779 filling stations.
Director Tassilo Peyrer-Heimstaett told a news conference that the firm aimed to open an additional 100 outlets abroad by the end of 1998. He forecast OMV's network in Austria would shrink to 570 stations over the same period.
"In Austria we will undertake a massive closure programme at the same time as we invest in high volume outlets," Peyrer-Heimstaett said.
Chief executive Richard Schenz said OMV would invest 1.5 billion schillings in its marketing arm this year. -- Janet McBride, Vienna Newsroom 43-1-531 12 254
