Bema Gold Corp and Arizona Star Resource Corp said Thursday they have completed a deal for a C$14 million private placement in Arizona Star.
Bema said it will purchase one million common shares of Arizona Star at C$14 per share.
The money will be used to fund Arizona Star's portion of more deep diamond drilling on the Cerro Casale gold and copper porphyry deposit at the Aldebaran property in Chile.
More drilling results from this deposit are expected within two weeks, the companies said.  
The property is 51 percent owned by Arizona and 49 percent by Bema.
Recent drilling at Cerro Casale has confirmed the existence of a major gold copper deposit beneath the existing two million ounce oxide gold deposit which is in the final feasibility stage.
Arizona Star said it also plans to use some of the proceeds to fund driling on other parts of the Aldebaran property in October.
