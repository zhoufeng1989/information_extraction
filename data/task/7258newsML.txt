The consortium buying New Zealand's state-owned Forestry Corporation will raise two thirds of the $2.026 billion purchase price through borrowings, corporate sources said on Wednesday.
The highly leveraged buyout would see the parties to the deal providing NZ$640 million in equity with Fletcher Challenge Forest Division and Chinese government investment arm Citic each injecting $240 million in equity. Each holds 37.5 percent of the consortium which bought Forestry Corp.  
New Zealand-based investment company Brierley Investments Ltd will provide $160 million in equity funding for its 25 percent stake.
The consortium holding company will raise about $1.4 billion in debt, made up of $300 million in subordinated debt and the balance in bank debt, the sources said.
Fletcher Challenge is to release details of the structure and funding at a video conference at 5 p.m. on Wednesday (0500 GMT). -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746
