Bulgaria's Privatisation Agency said on Thursday it has sold six hotels and restaurants in the Black Sea resorts of Zlatni Pyasatsi and Slanchev Bryag for a total of 178.7 million levs.
The Bulgarian-based buyers will have to invest some 1.3 billion levs over the next three years. The sold hotels include Zdravets and Varnenchik in Zlatni Pyasatsi and Nartsis in Slanchev Bryag.
Last week the Privatisation Agency sold eight other hotels and restaurants in the two large purpose-built holiday complexes.
The resorts' slow privatisation procedure, launched two years ago, had so far hampered major investments as long-term business plans could not be made, resort managers have said.
Germans and Russians top the list of foreign visitors to Bulgaria's Black Sea coast, followed by Britons and Scandinavians. -- Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-84561
