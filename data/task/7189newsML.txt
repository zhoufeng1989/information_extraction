Mobil Corp's Australian unit said on Wednesday its 108,000 barrels per day oil refinery in Melbourne was operating at 80 percent of normal output following the repair of its cracking unit.  
"The cracker is up and running," a Mobil spokeswoman told Reuters.
She said the refinery was expected to return to normal output by the middle of next week, pending the repair of one of three crude oil distillation units at the site.
The refinery's cracker, which was shut down eight days ago for repairs, extracts gas, gasoline, diesel and LPG products after the crude distillation process.
The Mobil spokeswoman said the refinery was still taking 100 percent Gippsland crude input instead of its usual practice of supplementing Gippsland crude input with imports.  
Gippsland crude is piped from the offshore Bass Strait fields owned 50/50 by Exxon Corp subsidiary Esso Australia Ltd and The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd.
She declined to comment on the refinery's current crude oil intake.
A Mobil source said Monday the refinery ordinarily took about 11 megalitres a day of Gippsland crude, representing half of its total normal crude oil intake.
