A Dutch subsidiary of Turkey's Garanti Bank said on Tuesday it had signed a $65 million credit agreement.
The credit accord, at 62.5 bps over LIBOR, is being arranged by Rabobank Nederland, Standard Chartered and West LB and was signed in Amsterdam on August 14.
United Garanti Bank International NV said the new agreement follows a $50 million accord last year at 75 bps over LIBOR.
The credit will be used to finance increasing trade transactions in Turkey, Europe and the United States. It said the credit agreement may be extended after one year.
