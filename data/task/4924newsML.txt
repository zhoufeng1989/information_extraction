Austrian oil and chemicals group OMV AG said on Tuesday it expected to achieve a flat profit this year despite a likely downturn in the second half.
"For the full year we expect a satisfactory group result which should match last year. The second half, like last year, will be characterised by weaker results," OMV said in a letter to shareholders.
In 1995, Austria's biggest industrial group posted a record pre-tax profit of 2.09 billion schillings and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 2.19 billion.
Gas, which contributed a hefty 1.73 billion schillings to group EBIT in 1995, should post stable earnings, OMV said.
It forecast improved full-year results in exploration and production, marketing and chemicals.
Cost-cutting should help reduce the group's full-year loss in exploration and production, despite an expected drop in crude oil prices in the second half, OMV said.
The firm noted its chemicals operations had benefited from restructuring and forecast that its marketing arm would post a positive result if the tax environment did not worsen.
However, OMV said it expected a downturn in plastics and refining. Plastics profits were dampened by weaker polyolefin prices while refining margins were being squeezed by lower ethylene and propylene prices, it said.
