Ratings agency Standard and Poor's will be reaffirming or looking to reaffirm its rating for Fletcher Challenge, S&P forestry sector director Paul Stephen told the New Zealand Press Association on Wednesday.
"From Fletcher's perspective, it's very much a core business of theirs. Their cash outlay is relatively modest and it allows them access to some of the best forests in New Zealand," Stephen, who is Melbourne-based, said.
In August 1995, Standard and Poor's gave Fletcher Challenge a stable outlook for its investment grade long-term domestic BBB rating.  
Fletcher Forests bought a 37.5 percent share of Forestry Corp of New Zealand on Tuesday. The total price for FCNZ was NZ$2.026 billion.
Stephen said Fletcher's 37.5 percent Chinese government-owned partner in Forestry Corp, Citic, had been rated BBB with a positive outlook.
