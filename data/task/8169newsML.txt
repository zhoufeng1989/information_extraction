An American Airlines jet stopped just before takeoff from LaGuardia Airport on Wednesday night when a fire was detected in one of the engines, airport officials said.
The pilot of American Flight 803 bound for Miami "discovered an indicator light indicating a possible engine fire" and turned the plane around before lifting off, said Gwen Williams, a spokeswoman for the Port Authority, the agency that oversees local airports.
None of the 63 passengers were injured, she said.
Mechanics for American Airlines, operated by Dallas-based AMR Corp ,found that there had been a fire in the number two engine of the 727 aircraft that had "self-extinguished," Williams said.
Passengers interviewed by local television news said the plane started accelerating for takeoff, when they heard popping sounds and the pilot brought the plane to a halt.
The incident came a week after two planes in as many days rained plane parts on New York City.
Last Wednesday night a Delta Airlines plane dropped a turbine piece on Flushing, Queens. On Thursday night a 9-foot-long (2.8-meter-long) wing flap from a TWA jet fell on the Howard Beach neighborhood of Queens before the plane landed at nearby John F. Kennedy International Airport.
American confirmed that the plane had engine trouble, but had no further details or comment.
