Kushner-Locke Co said Thursday it had secured an $8 million contract from ABC Television to produce the first six episodes, including the pilot episode, of a new series called "Gun."
Kushner-Locke will retain foreign distribution rights to the series, which has Robert Altman and Jim Sadwith as executive producers .
"Gun" follows the trail of a pearl-handled, semi-automatic pistol as it passes in and out of the hands of a different set of characters in each week's episode.
