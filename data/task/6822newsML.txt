Coastal Resources Ltd said on Wednesday it reached an agreement with the board of directors of Canadian Jorex Ltd whereby the board will recommend Jorex shareholders accept an offer from Coastal to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Jorex for cash at a price of C$0.68 per share.
Coastal, a private, Calgary-based oil and gas company, said the offer will remain open until September 12 and is conditional upon at least two-thirds of the outstanding Jorex shares being tendered under the offer.
It said it will fund the acquisition of the Jorex shares through cash on hand and existing lines of credit.
The Coastal offer represents an eight-percent premium to the previously announced cash offer of C$0.63 a share by Cypress Energy Inc and a 26-percent premium to the closing price of C$0.54 on July 8, the date prior to Cypress announcing its offer.
Coastal said a major Jorex shareholder, representing about 53.1 percent of the fully diluted outstanding shares, has agreed to tender its shares under Coastal's offer, subject to the right of Cypress to match Coastal's offer.
