Federal regulators have given Kiwi International Air Lines the green light to start flying two more planes after the carrier cut back its flights in June due to problems with record-keeping, the company said Tuesday.
The Federal Aviation Administration's action means the carrier is again allowed to operate all of its 15 aircraft.
Kiwi cut about 25 percent of its flights in late June after an examination by the agency revealed problems involving pilot training records at the airline.
