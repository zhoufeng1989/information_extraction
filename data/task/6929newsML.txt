Energen Corp said on Wednesday that its oil and gas exploration and production subsidiary, Taurus Exploration Inc, retains sole ownership of the estimated 100 billion cubic feet of coalbed methane reserves recently purchased from Burlington Resources Inc.
Energen said that neither of Taurus's eligible coalbed methane partners elected to participate in the acquisition, as provided for under the terms of two area of mutual interest agreements.  
An Energen spokeswoman told Reuters that the two eligible partners were subsidiaries of TECO Energy Inc and Chevron Corp.
