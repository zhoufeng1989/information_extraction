Iberia said it was suspending direct flights between Palma de Mallorca and London, Paris and Frankfurt from next month because the routes are unprofitable.
The daily London service will stop on September 2 and the three and four times a week French and German links cease towards the end of the month.
Iberia passengers will thereafter have to change planes in Barcelona unless the flag carrier's Viva subsidiary takes on the routes as has happened with some services abandoned by Iberia in the past. A spokeswoman said this had not yet been decided.-- --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel +44 171 542 8982 Fax +44 171 542 5017
