Japanese consumer finance firms are likely to remain competitive despite an increase in personal bankruptcies, deteriorating asset quality and cut-throat competition, Moody's Investors Service said.
Despite the host of negative factors, the firms should be able to survive because of their underwriting and collection expertise, the rating agency said on Tuesday.
Moody's said the rating outlook for specialised consumer finance firms Takefuji Corp, which will list on the over-the-counter market on August 30, and Sanyo Shimpan Finance Co Ltd was stable.  
Sales finance company Orient Corp's rating was also stable, Moody's said.
It added that sales finance firms were more vulnerable to deteriorating asset quality due to weaker financial fundamentals than their counterparts in consumer finance.
"Sales finance firms' impaired assets in the corporate lending segment are also an area of concern," Moody's said.
