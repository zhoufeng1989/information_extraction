Leading Lithuanian commercial bank Vilnius Bank, half owned by U.S. giant Bankers Trust, said on Wednesday it is to start selling its products via the 900 offices of the state-owned Lithuanian Post Office.
The bank, in which Bankers Trust recently bought a 51.47 stake, said it signed a letter of intent on long-term cooperation with the post office.
"This long-term investment decision is to enable Vilnius Bank to enter a potentially large local market for the sale of bank cards, cheques, electronic mail services and accumulating deposits," the bank said in a statement.
The bank gave no financial figures in connection with the agreement.
Vilnius said it currently controlled 15 percent of Lithuania's financial market with 13 branches.
Vilnius became the leading bank after the closure of former largest commercial bank Innovation Bank in a bank crisis late last year.
Lithuania is still dealing with the after-effects of the crisis, that has also hit state-owned banks.
