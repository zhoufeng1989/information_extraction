IMI's forecast for 1996 earnings per share (EPS) is based on the firm's current 6.06 million shares outstanding against 571,000 shares as of December 31, 1995, it said.
The dramatic increase in the number of IMI shares is mainly due to a share split the company carried out on May 1. IMI split each of its shares, which had a face value of 500 yen, into 10 shares with a 50-yen face value. It also issued an additional 350,000 shares on July 24, IMI said.
