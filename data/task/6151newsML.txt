German state-owned telecommunications firm Deutsche Telekom is interested in buying the fixed line network of Brazil's telecommunication company Telebras when it is privatized next year, a newspaper said.
German Telecommunications Minister Wolfgang Botsch said the German firm was not interested in buying into Brazil's private cellular phone network because it wanted to buy Telebras' fixed line network, according to Jornal do Brasil.
The German minister is currently on a week-long official visit to Brazil.
