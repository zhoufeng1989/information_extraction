Shares in Pearson stumbled as investors took profits after a recent run-up, traders said.
By 1256 GMT, Pearson's shares were down 11-1/2p to 662p.  
Profit-taking in the shares -- which gained about 12.5 percent during the first two weeks of August -- may have been sparked by worries that rising paper prices will squeeze Pearson's profits, said one trader.
An analyst suggested that there may have been a bit of switching today and Monday from Pearson's shares into EMI shares, which began trading as a separately listed company on Monday. Shares in EMI were up another 24p to 1484p.
The downside in Pearson, the analyst added, is likely to be limited by recurring speculation about a breakup or a bid.
