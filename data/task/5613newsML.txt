Independent Bank Corp said Wednesday it will purchase eight branch offices from First of America Bank Corp's Michigan banking unit.
The offices have deposits totaling about $125 million and are near Independent Bank's current Michigan markets.
The proposed transaction needs regulatory approvals as well as the execution of a definitive agreement. It is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 1996.
Independent Bank had total assets of $777 million at June 30, 1996. First of America, headquartered in Kalamazoo, Mich., has $22 billion in assets.
