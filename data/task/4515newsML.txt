Carter Holt Harvey Ltd, one of the rival bidders for state-owned Forestry Corp of New Zealand, said on Tuesday it was simply outpriced by the winning Fletcher Challenge-led consortium.
"I think the essential thing was that they put the best price on the table," CHH Forests Chief Executive Devon McLean told Reuters. "It was a price that we were not in a position to reach," he said.
"We saw it as a good opportunity...at the right price. We bid as good a price as we could and we were not successful."  
McLean said CHH already had a large forest resource that was continuing to increase in terms of woodflow.
"It will increase 50 percent over the next 10 years so it is not a question of us being short of fibre. We have plenty of plans in place for further wood processing from our own estate."
CHH, just over half owned by International Paper, was in a joint venture with Maori group Te Ama Ltd and Malaysia's Jaya Tiasa for FCNZ, which has 188,000 hectares of plantation forests in the central North Island.  
The government earlier announced a sale to a consortium comprising Fletcher Challenge, Brierley Investments Ltd and China's Citic, for NZ$2.026 billion.
