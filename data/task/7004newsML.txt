Pacific Gas and Electric Co's Diablo Canyon nuclear power units were operating at 82 percent of capacity and increasing power early Wednesday after cutting output this week due to a wildfire, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) said.
The two units were "increasing reactor power to 100 percent," the NRC said in its daily plant status report. Each of the units was operating at 82 percent, the report said.
The plant's two units, with a combined capacity of 2,160 megawatts (MW), were operating at 75 percent of production Tuesday after the company shut two 5,000 kilovolt (KV) transmission lines from Diablo Canyon due to a nearby wildfire.
All electricity transmission from the plant was being run through one 5,000 MW line which was farther removed from the fire than the two shut lines.
A company representative said Tuesday the units were expected to reach full output Wednesday.
A company spokesman was not immediately available for comment early Wednesday morning.
Diablo Canyon is at Avila Beach on the California Coast.
