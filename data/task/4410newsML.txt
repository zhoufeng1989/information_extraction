Leading European cartonboard manufacturer Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG (MMK) said on Tuesday it was committed to paying out a dividend for 1996 after scrapping its dividend last year.
"The dividend for 1996 has already been secured through payments that have come into the parent company," chief executive Michael Groeller told journalists after presenting the company's first-half earnings.
Groeller declined to say how big the dividend would be but said that "our shareholders will be satisfied."
Earlier this year investors were miffed when MMK reported an 18 percent jump in 1995 group pre-tax profit to 430 million schillings but decided to scrap its dividend after paying out 14 schillings in 1994.
MMK decided to forego a 1995 dividend after profits at the holding company were wiped out by a write-down in Germany, where its FS Karton AG unit suffered significant losses.
