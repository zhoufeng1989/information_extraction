Tylan General Inc said Monday it is exploring the possible sale of the company and added it has already received some inquiries from potential buyers.
Tylan Chairman, President and Chief Executive David Ferran said the company was considering making an acquisition proposal with Don Whitson, the vice chairman and chief administrative officer.
The company has set up a committee of directors to oversee the process. Goldman, Sachs & Co has been retained as its financial adviser.
The company said there is no assurance that an acquisition proposal would be received or that a satisfactory agreement could be negotiated.
Tylan supplies process-management equipment around the world.
