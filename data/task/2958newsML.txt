Box Energy Corp's new but embattled President and Chief Executive Officer Don Box said on Tuesday there will be no "fire sale" of the company, despite rumors that his leadership would be tanatmount to an immediate sale.
August 8 Box Energy seated a new board that fired Tom Box as CEO and installed his brother Don, in what people close to the situation called a family war over control of the company.
In an open letter to stockholders dated Friday, Don Box said the company must develop a more strategic approach to exploration and production and get better control over costs.
