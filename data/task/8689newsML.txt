-- Merrill Lynch & Co said it is maintaining its accumulate rating on Brazilian steelmaker Companhia Siderurgica de Tubarao, known as CST, despite poor second-quarter results.
-- The bank cited projections for higher slab prices, which rose in the second quarter to $227 a ton compared with $214 a ton in the first three-monthperiod.
-- Merrill Lynch said CST's 35.5 million real second quarter net, was actually bloated by 32.6 million-real "extraordinary item," which when subtracted gives the firm a three million real net income versus projections of 20.4 million reais.  
-- The bank said it is reluctant to judge CST based on one quarter but that future quarters will receive more scrutiny.
-- CST's voting common was unchanged at 17.99 reais at 1244 local/1544 gmt on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange.
