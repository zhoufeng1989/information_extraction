Financial services group Internationale Nederlanden Groep NV (ING) said on Thursday the influence of the Barings acquisition was clearly seen in rises in first half commission and trading income and operating costs.
But ING said it was no longer possible to report the direct effect of the March 1995 acquisition on its results in the first half of 1996 because all ING investment banking activities had now been integrated into the ING Barings business unit.  
ING earlier announced a net profit of 1.51 billion guilders in the first half of 1996, up from 1.18 billion a year earlier.
In the first half, commission rose 45 percent to 1.29 billion guilders, results from financial transactions soared 156.7 percent to 534 million and operating spending increased 21.9 percent to 3.92 billion.
ING bought Barings, the British merchant bank which collapsed last year with huge trading losses, for 1.7 billiion guilders.
