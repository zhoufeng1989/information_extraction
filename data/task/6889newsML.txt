Minnesota Power & Light Co said Wednesday it agreed to acquire a remaining 17 percent minority interest in ADESA, the company's Indianapolis-based auto auction business.
The 17 percent stake will be acquired at undisclosed terms from shareholders, who include managers of ADESA. Minnesota Power acquired an 83 percent stake in ADESA in 1995.
ADESA operates 17 auto auction centers in the U.S. and four in Canada.
Minnesota Power also said James Hallett, 43, ADESA executive vice president and president of ADESA's Canadian operations, has been named president and chief executive officer of ADESA.
Hallett succeeds D. Michael Hockett, former chief executive officer and founder, who is retiring from ADESA and Minnesota Power's board of directors. Larry Wechter, president of ADESA, and a few other executives who had been part of a group that formed ADESA, are also leaving the company, the company said.
Besides ADESA, Minnesota Power's businesses include electric utility operations in Minnesota and Wisconsin, water utilities in Florida and the Carolinas.
