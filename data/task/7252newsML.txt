The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) said on Wednesday it saw a rise in troublesome loans and a deterioration in its operating environment.
"We see three factors affecting the outlook for Australian banks ... the operating environment has deteriorated...there has been an uplift in troublesome loans in the fourth quarter...and costs," CBA managing director David Murray told reporters.  
"We aim to maintain the current dividend payout to earnings per share ratio barring unforseen circumstances," Murray said.
CBA earlier reported a 13.8 percent increase in its net profit for the 12 month to June 30, 1996 to A$1.12 billion.
Te bank said it expected to see flat earnings earnings in the 1996/97 year but that its earnings per share should improve because of a share buyback.
"If we continue to maintain a low inflation environment the the outlook for bad and doubtful debts expense for banks is much brighter than it was the last time round," Murray said, referring to the 1990/91 recession.  
At 11.24 a.m. (0124 GMT), CBA shares were 13 cents higher at A$11.18.  -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 373-1800
