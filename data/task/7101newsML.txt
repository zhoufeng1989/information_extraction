Shares in Finnish passenger ferry operator Silja Oy rose sharply on Wednesday on positive views on the company's future after H1 data suggested that a negative trend in prices and volumes had ended, brokers said.
At 1610/1310 GMT, Silja traded at 33.00, markka, up one markka or 3.1 percent. Volume was a moderate four million.
"The price level is becoming healthier now," one broker said. An international brokerage's comments about detrimental price competition between Silja and rival Viking Line reported in the Kauppalehti on Tuesday were based on old data, he said.
"Silja has a completely changed risk profile now...," he said.
Another broker said that one brokerage had given a buy recommendation based on Silja's result prospects.
