British Telecommunications Plc said it will introduce new pricing systems for digital communications systems aimed at small to medium-sized operations based on customer use and cash flow from September 23.
It said the new pricing for ISDN-2 would allow the cost to be spread over two years, reducing initial costs of joining.
Start Up targets first-time users with a lower connection fee of 199 stg and higher rental.
It gives a yearly call allowance of 90 stg for two years and 210 stg after. Businesses could save up to 14.5 percent in the first year on previous ISDN-2 levels, BT said.  
The second option, Fast Start, is aimed at customers who have used ISDN and know usage rates.
The connection fee is 680 stg and rental 130 stg a quarter afterwards, with a call allowance of 650 stg in the first year and 210 stg thereafter.
BT said that was a 25 percent saving on previous ISDN-2 prices in the first year.
Low Start targets low users or customers using ISDN to provide back-up for private circuit services.
The connection charge is unchanged but rental is increased with a call allowance of 210 stg per annum, saving over eight percent on previous ISDN-2 prices.
"The introduction of call allowances will make it easier for businesses to try out new and innovative applications," said June Campbell, BT marketing manager of ISDN services.
The previous rate for ISDN-2 for all users was a 400 stg connection charge with 84 stg a quarter rental and no call allowance, giving a total cost of 736 stg.
Rental charges for customers who do not select one of the new options will go up to 88 stg a quarter from October 1, BT said.
