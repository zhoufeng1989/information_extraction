Britain's largest mortgage lender Halifax Building Society said on Tuesday it was considering what to do with its excess capital, after it has completed its stock market flotation planned for June 1997.
Group finance director Roger Boyes told reporters at the society's interim results briefing the Halifax had a tier 1 capital ratio of 14.4 percent.
That would give the society a "reasonably substantial" surplus of capital after its flotation, he said.
He said options to be looked at included acquisitions, special or enhanced dividends and a share buy-back.
"It's quite wrong to say that Halifax is not aware of all the options," he said when it was suggested the society would be most likely to seek acquisitions.
Boyes said Halifax would also look at the best balance between its tier 1 and tier 2 capital, which he said was currently weighted 90 percent to 10.
He said this was expensive, hinting at further issurance of the subordinated debt, which makes up tier 2 capital.
Halifax said it issued 775 million stg of subordinated debt in recent months.
