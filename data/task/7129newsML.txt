Metals trading firm Mytilineos said first half pretax profit was up 67 percent at 559 million drachmas on turnover growth of 67 percent at 13.88 billion.
"The rise in first half turnover came about from expanding international sales and a rise in the domestic market share for several products despite a flat market this year," the company said in a statement.
Mytilineos experienced increased sales in Israel, Turkey, Italy, Egypt and central Europe.
