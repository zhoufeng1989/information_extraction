The National Science Foundation (NSF) said it was withholding approval to buy four Japanese-made supercomputers until dumping allegations are resolved.
U.S. supercomputer maker Cray Research filed a petition July 29 with the Commerce Department alleging Japan's NEC Corp was selling supercomputers on the U.S. market at less than fair prices.
"In my view, it would be inappropriate for NSF to approve this procurement until the dumping issue has been resolved," NSF director Neal Lane said in a statement dated Aug 20 but received here Wednesday.  
The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) tentatively agreed on May 20 to buy four NEC supercomputer systems. The government-funded NSF is the primary funding agency.
Lane said he was acutely aware that the NCAR needed state-of-the-art equipment to maintain world leadership in climate modeling research. "I feel, however that acting now on this procurement would be inconsistent with the responsible stewardship of taxpayer monies," he said.
Both the Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission have said they will investigate the dumping charges which NEC has strenuously denied.
The ITC will make a preliminary determination by September 12 on whether or not U.S. industry is being injured.
If the ITC's preliminary decision is affirmative, the Commerce Department has said it will continue its investigation and issue it own preliminary finding no later than January 6, 1997.
