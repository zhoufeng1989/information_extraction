EA Industries Inc said on Wednesday that Chairman Irwin Gross bought about $2.1 million of the company's convertible notes from GFL Advantage Fund Ltd and GFL Performance Fund Ltd.
The company said another long-term shareholder has also bought about $1 million in convertible notes from the GFL funds.
Gross has agreed to convert the note in advance of the due date, and the company has agreed to issue additional shares to him, it said.  After conversion, Gross will own about 1,060,000 shares of EA.  
The other shareholder converted his note into about 380,000 shares on August 19.
The conversions will result in about $300,000 in interest savings to EA over the term of the notes, the company said.
It said that between March and August 1996, the GFL funds converted and sold over 2.2 million shares into the market, which tended to depress the price of EA shares.  
"We welcome this opportunity to move shares from short-term financial players into the hands of long-term investors," Gross said in a statement.
