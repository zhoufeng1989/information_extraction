The stock of SDL Inc. lost nearly a third of its value Thursday after the semiconductor laser maker told analysts that third quarter sales would be flat with the prior quarter's because a manufacturing problem was reducing output.
SDL stock fell $9 to $19 on Nasdaq, where it was among the most active issues.
SDL said its yield, or the number of flawless dye -- the silicon squares that eventually become chips -- per wafer was down in three of its product lines. Also, executives said they had not yet found the root of the problem.
As a consequence, SDL said it would be late in delivering some orders and has had to turn away some new orders as well.
It said revenues should be about the same as the second quarter's $21.6 million -- a sudden halt for the high-flying company whose revenues grew 83 percent in the year's first half.
San Jose-based SDL makes semiconductor lasers, semiconductor optoelecronic integrated circuits and fiber optic related products. Its market is largely the telecommunications industry, which is fast upgrading its equipment.
