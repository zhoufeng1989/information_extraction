NASHVILLE, Tenn, Aug 20, (Reuter) Shoney's Inc on Monday reported its third-quarter results, showing same store sales increased 0.5 percent after menu prices were increased by 2.1 percent during the quarter.
Shoney's Chairman and Chief Executive Stephen Lynn called the restaurant chain's results "not yet at an acceptable level" and "less than desired." He attributed the sales results to "a difficult sales environment throughout the industry in May and June."
For the first 40 weeks of the fiscal year, Shoney's comparable store sales decreased by 0.3 percent, including a 1.7 percent increase in menu prices.
Lynn said the outlook is promising, saying that the trend of same store sales improved in the last six weeks of the quarter and that the trend has continued into the first weeks of the fourth quarter.
