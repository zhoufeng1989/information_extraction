Fletcher Challenge Forest Division said on Tuesday it might sell other forests to help fund the purchase of Forestry Corp of New Zealand.
Apart from the sale of other forests, Fletcher Forest would not need to raise fresh capital, Chief Executive Mike Andrews said.
He said Fletcher Forest and FCNZ's operations in the central North Island would be merged.
