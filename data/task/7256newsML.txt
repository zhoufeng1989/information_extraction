Shares in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia jumped 12 cents to A$11.17 in early trade on Wednesday following its 16.6 percent higher year pre-tax operating profit of A$1.78 billion, brokers said.  
"Commonwealth Bank has been the performer," said dealer Duncan Gamble of Wilson HTM.
"Their results have been very well-received with no selling around in the stock."
While the shares turned in an strong performance, the instalment receipts were the star of the show, adding 13 cents or about 1.9 percent to A$7.07.
"The (dividend) yield on the receipts is impressive," Gamble said.  
Commonwealth Bank instalment receipts are a form of partly paid security and were issued when the Federal government disposed of its remaining 50.4 percent stake in the bank in July 1996.
Receipt holders must make a payment of A$4.45 per receipt by November 14, 1997.
By 11.25 a.m. (0125 GMT), Commonwealth Bank shares were 12 cents higher at A$11.17 on turnover of 733,490 shares, while its receipts were 14 cents higher at A$7.07 on turnover of 1.37 million receipts.
