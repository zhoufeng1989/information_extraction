The chief executive of British Airways, Bob Ayling, has rejected suggestions that talks between Britain and the United States for a new open skies agreement would collapse, the Guardian reported.
Speaking in Sydney, Australia, Ayling said an open skies agreement would give British airlines greater access to U.S. airports and would give American airlines improved facilities at Heathrow airport, the newspaper reported.
Ayling's comments followed a published report by the Financial Times on Tuesday saying British officials were taking a tough line on the aviation negotiations.
The Financial Times said Britain would not agree to an open skies pack modeled on a similar agreement between the U.S. and Germany.
Ayling urged the governments of both countries to free up competition as a condition for approving the proposed alliance of British Airways and AMR Corp's American Airlines, the newspaper said. Ayling also said that, if the competition deal goes ahead, the proposed alliance would become effective on April 1, 1997, the paper said.
Talks between the U.S. and Britain are set to resume in Washington on August 28 to 29.
