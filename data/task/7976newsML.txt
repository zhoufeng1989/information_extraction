FKI, UK material handling to engineering and process control group, said on Thursday that results for the first four months of the new year were in line with expectations and well ahead of the same period last year.  
"I am delighted to report that we are continuing to make further progress in the new year, having increased pretax profits by one-third in the 12 months to last March," chairman Jeff Whalley told shareholders at the annual meeting.
"I therefore remain confident that once again, the year ahead will demonstrate continuing progress for FKI."
