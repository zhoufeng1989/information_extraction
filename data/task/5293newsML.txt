The truck unit of Swedish vehicle maker AB Volvo on Wednesday said its order book in the middle of 1996 was 46 percent lower than a year ago.
"The order backlog at June 30, 1996, was 46 percent lower than on the same date a year earlier due primarily to weaker order bookings in North and South America," Volvo's chief executive Soren Gyll said in the company's half-year report.
For the first half of 1996 Volvo Truck posted an operating profit of 1.08 billion crowns against 2.94 billion crowns a year earlier. Sales slipped 10 percent to 23.11 billion crowns.
Volvo said the world market for heavy trucks declined in the first half compared wtih a year ago and the total market in North and South America weakened perceptibly.
Gyll said earnings in Europe, where the market as a whole strengthened, were satisfactory but lower than a year earlier.
"Operations in North America resulted in a substantial loss due largely to a smaller volume of sales and pressure on margins," he said.
"A restructuring programme is under way but a significant loss is also anticipated in the second half of the year."
