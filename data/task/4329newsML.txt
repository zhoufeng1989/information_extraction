Analysts were mostly confident that Pakhoed will post healthy second-half 1996 profits and achieve growth in 1997 after restructuring charges hit first-half 1996 profits published on Tuesday.
"We are considering upgrading our forecasts for the whole year and also for 1997," said Corne Zandbergen, analyst at Generale Bank.
Pakhoed's first-half net earnings were more or less unchanged from 1995 after stripping out a 15 million guilder write-down on tank storage assets and a gain of about seven million from preferential tax treatment, analysts said.
Analysts point to improvements in chemical storage performance and the conclusion of a substantial long-term contract in Singapore as promising for future growth.
"These are certainly positive indicators," said Pieter van Gelder, transport analyst at Delta Lloyd Bank.
Zandbergen said Pakhoed's shedding of its Furness port services unit and its acquisition of chemical distribution firm Univar represented a rational repositioning.
"We are pleased they have decided to shed Furness.. and the acquisition of Univar leaves them much more in line with their core activities," Zandbergen said.
However, some analysts raised doubts over Pakhoed's purchase of Univar for 521 million guilders, questioning the financing of the operation and expecting additional costs.
"Pakhoed want to finalise the acquisition in the second half, but it doesn't include every part of it. Maintenance costs will have a negative effect and the total cost could easily be well be over 521 million," said van Gelder.
