Japan's Asahi Glass Co Ltd will invest $100 million to produce sheet glass in Vietnam from 1998, a Japanese newspaper reported on Tuesday.
The Nihon Keizai Shimbun said that upon approval from the Vietnamese government, Asahi Glass would set up a joint venture with Vietnamese partners to build a plant in Ho Chi Minh City capable of producing 500 tonnes of sheet glass a day.
The products would be sold in Vietnam and exported to Laos, Cambodia and Burma, it said.
Officials of Asahi Glass were not immediately available for comment.
