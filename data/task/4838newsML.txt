The owners of Israel's Union Bank are negotiating to purchase an additional 23.2 percent stake in the company from the government, a government official said.
Meir Jacobson, managing director of M.I. Holdings, in charge of privatising Israel's banks, said the company had started a dialogue with a consortium headed by businessman Shlomo Eliahu, to sell the government stake in the commercial bank.
The Eliahu consortium already holds some 60 percent of shares in the bank, the country's sixth largest.
M.I. Holdings had planned to sell the government's stake on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, but Jacobson said the share offering had been put on hold because of the discussions with Eliahu.
The Maariv daily said the Eliahu group was also interested in purchasing an additional 16.8 percent stake in the company held by Bank Leumi. A spokesman for the consortium was not immediately available for comment.
The Eliahu consortium bought control of Union Bank in 1993 after it was privatised. Founded in 1951, the bank was for many years part of the Bank Leumi group.
