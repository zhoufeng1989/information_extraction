Reliance National and an African-American insurance executive said they plan to form a new property-casualty company to insure public utilities and corporations with commitments to buy products and services from minority-owned business enterprises.
Onyx Insurance Co will be capitalized at more than $5 million and will be jointly owned by Aaron Richardson as the majority common shareholder and Reliance National, a unit of Reliance Group Holdings Inc.
Reliance declined to disclose the size of its or Richardson's stake.  
Richardson, a 29-year veteran of the insurance industry, will serve as the chairman and chief executive of Onyx.
Upon approval by the California insurance department, Onyx Insurance Co will be the only African-American owned property-casualty insurance company in the United States.  
"There is clearly a great opportunity for a minority-owned company with sufficient capacity to participate in the insurance programs of public entities and large corporations," said Dennis Busti, chief executive of Reliance National.
Onyx will retain a small portion of each risk and reinsure the remainder through Reliance National, enabling Onyx to spread its risk and quickly establish a broad customer base.
"There are more than 2,600 property-casualty insurance companies in the United States with a combined net income of over $20 billion and assets of nearly $232 billion," Richardson said.
"Yet not one of these companies is African-American owned. The formation of Onyx Insurance Company is an important step toward African-American participation in the economic mainstream of America," he said.
Richardson is the founder and owner of ARISCO (Aaron Richardson Insurance Services Corp), a San Francisco-based property-casualty insurance brokerage that he formed in 1990.
