South African group Barlow Ltd said on Wednesday it would list its ordinary shares on the Namibian Stock Exchange (NSE) on September 11.
The shares will have full Namibian asset status.
Barlows chairman Warren Clewlow said the move reflected the company's faith in the Namibian economy and the success of the NSE, which was proving an increasingly attractive institution for local and foreign investors.
"For this reason, we think it appropriate that our Namibian-based investors should have the opportunity to deal in Barlow shares through their own stock market."
Barlows has a significant presence in Namibia through its Windhoek-based Sonnex subsidiary, which employs around 360 people.
Activities include the distribution of Caterpillar and Hyster equipment, the manufacture of Plascon paints and the production of building materials. 
From September 1, Sonnex will also be countrywide franchise holder for BMW and Landrover, except for Landrover in Walvis Bay and Swakopmund.
The NSE, founded four years ago, currently has 26 listed companies.
