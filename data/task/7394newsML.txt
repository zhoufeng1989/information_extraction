Shenzhen-listed drug firm Jilin Pharmaceutical Co Ltd said its after-tax earnings fell 44 percent year-on-year to 5.47 million yuan in the first half of 1996 under Chinese accounting standards.
That compared with 9.72 million yuan racked up in the year-ago period, it said in an interim report published in the Shenzhen-based Securities Times.
Its main operating income reached only 104.55 million yuan, versus 105.13 million yuan in the first half of 1995.
The company said the decline in profits was due in part to rate rises on electricity and to higher transport fees.
Beijing's reduction of export tax rebate levels also cut into the company's first-half profits, the report said.
Jilin Pharmaceutical said in its annual report for last year that a 26 percent decline in net earnings for 1995 was primarily triggered by price rises for raw materials and a steep drop in returns on investments.
The firm said that it had net earnings of 17.39 million yuan last year, down from 23.50 million yuan in 1994.
Higher prices for precursor chemicals and the firm's limited ability to pass the costs on to consumers cut into profit margins last year, it said.
An official at the firm said earlier that its business outlook for 1996 remained gloomy in light of the central government's ongoing moves to slash export tax rebates.
Sales of the its leading product, aspirin, accounted for about one-third of the company's main operating income annually, the official said.
The firm exported about 95 percent of the drug, he added.
