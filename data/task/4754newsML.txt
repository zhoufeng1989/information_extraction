Japan hopes the United States will take "appropriate" steps in its anti-dumping investigation into Japanese supercomputers, Trade Minister Shunpei Tsukahara told reporters on Tuesday.
"We want the U.S. government to cope with the issue appropriately," Tsukahara told a news conference.
The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday said it had initiated an anti-dumping investigation into Japanese supercomputers.
U.S. supercomputer maker Cray Research Inc filed a petition on July 29 with the department and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) alleging that Japan's NEC Corp was selling supercomputers on the U.S. market at less than fair prices.
The ITC will make a preliminary determination by September 12 on whether U.S. companies were being injured by imports of supercomputers from Japan.
Tsukahara also said he would visit Sydney from August 26 to attend a meeting by energy ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group of nations.
