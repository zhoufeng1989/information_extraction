Annual sales of personal computers in China are expected to reach five million units by 2000, the Xinhua news agency said on Wednesday.
In 1995, 1.1 million personal computers were sold in the country, 50 percent more than in 1994, it said.
Computer sales last year totalled 55 billion yuan ($6.62 billion), 28 percent of which were personal computers, Xinhua added.
Individuals accounted for 15 percent of total personal computer sales, up from 10 percent in 1994, and state offices, government firms and other corporations accounted for the rest.
Half of the personal computers sold in China were imported, Xinhua said.
Over the next five years China planned to develop the market for home computers, it said but gave no further details.
