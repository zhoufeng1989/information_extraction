Portugal's Banco de Fomento & Exterior (BFE), which the government is in the process of privatising, said on Wednesday that net profit surged nearly 150 percent in the first half of the year.
But the profit rise to 16.2 billion escudos ($106.2 million), from 6.59 billion over the same period last year, was entirely due to windfall gains from the sale of its stake in state investment management group IPE-Investimentos e Participacoes Empresariais.
Without the profit from the sale, net profit over the first six months fell 2.1 percent to 6.45 billion escudos, the bank said in a statement.
A decision is expected soon on the winner of bidding for the 65 percent stake the government holds in BFE.
Three Portuguese groups are competing for the bank in a privatisation which should earn the government around $1 billion.
