The Inter-American Investment Corporation agreed on Thursday to lend $3 million and mobilize $15 million from commercial banks to help Argentine company PASA SA expand its petrochemical facilities.
The loans will help finance a $38 million project to increase PASA's production capacity of ammonia, urea and ethyl benzene, said the IIC, part of the Inter-American Development Bank Group.
About 20 percent of spending on the project will be invested in upgrading environmental control systems and equipment.
