Shares in Dutch tank storage and shipping group Pakhoed NV steamed five percent higher after an initial fall as investors digested a surprise 59.5 million guilder fall in net from ordinary operations.
The group posted first half net before extraordinaries of 4.6 million guilders, sharply below expectations of between 55 and 63 million. The firm also announced a 54.3 million guilder extraordinary charge.
The stock fell 1.30 guilders, or almost three percent, to 43.30 guilders before recovering to trade 2.30 guilders higher, or 5.4 percent, at 46.90 guilders.
The group was upbeat about prospects for the rest of the year. It said net profit from ordinary operations in the second half of 1996 would be "clearly higher" than in the same period of 1995.
