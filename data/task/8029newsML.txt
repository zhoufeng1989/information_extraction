Engineering firm Weir Group Plc repeated its earlier forecast that the second-half results will be stronger than in the first half and that the group will make full-year progress.
Weir earlier reported that first-half pre-tax profit fell 4.8 percent to 19.2 million stg, partly due to a lower profit contribution from Devonport Dockyard.
"Although the setback at Devonport is not helpful, nevertheless we can see no reason at this time for changing our views (on the full-year outlook)," chairman Viscount Weir said in a statement.
Devonport was hit by significant disruptions to its refitting programme due to modifications to meet increased safety requirements for existing docks.
Additionally, there was a slower than normal settlement of contracts with the Ministry of Defence, Weir Group said.
Beisdes Devonport, first-half results were also hit by a worse performance of Strachan and Henshaw, but this had been expected, Weir said.
