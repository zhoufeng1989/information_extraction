Vikonics Inc said on Thursday that it presently does not have the ability to meet its obligations, but it is trying to negotiate payment terms.
The company has aggregate amounts due to private investors, ex-directors and the company's legal counsel of $570,000 plus accrued interest due in June, Vikonics said.
At June 30, 1996, the company had cash on hand of $5,000, a working capital deficit of $1,372,000 and a shareholders' deficit of $1,369,000.
Vikonics said there can be no assurance that it will succeed in negotiating payment terms.
