New York state officials have approved a merger of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co and the New England Mutual Life Insurance Co, The New York Times reported on Tuesday.
The approval by the state's Department of Insurance was the last significant hurdle facing the deal.
Officials of both companies said a formal closing was scheduled for Aug 30. It will be the biggest merger in the mutual life insurance field.
Met Life, the second-biggest U.S. life insurer, is bringing about $150 billion in insurance assets. The new company will have more than $166 billion in assets, still trailing Prudential Insurance Co of America.
