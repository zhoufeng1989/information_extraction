Tiger Medicals Ltd, a pharmaceutical company which makes Tiger brand ointments for relieving muscle pains, said on Wednesday it expects a better second half in 1996 and the full year to be satisfactory.
It said its net profit in the first half of the year fell two percent to Singapore $43.93 million.
Group turnover increased by nine percent on account of higher sales of Tigher brand products in Asia and trading margins were maintained, it said.
But it said the group did not derive any significant exchange gain in the period and so earnings declined marginally by two percent.
