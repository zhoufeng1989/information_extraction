Austria's OMV AG said on Tuesday refining margins in Europe remained under intense pressure and forecast a growing trend towards cooperation and plant closures.
"Current refining margins are not only unsatisfactory, they are untenable in the long term," OMV director Tassilo Peyrer-Heimstaett told a news conference.
Wafer-thin margins have triggered a round of European refinery sales and closures over the past year. In February British Petroleum Co Plc and U.S. Mobil Corp announced they were merging their European downstream and refining operations.
"I would not be surprised to see further consolidation, maybe in southern Germany," Peyrer-Heimstaett said.
OMV said, based on its own model, complex refining margins had risen to $2.13 a barrel in the first half from a near all-time low of $1.45 at the start of the year.
Peyrer-Heimstaett did not foresse OMV entering into cooperation with another firm.
"In Burghausen our room for manouevre is zero. In Schwechat (cooperation) may be possible in theory," he said.
Burghausen processed 1.61 million tonnes of crude in the first six months. Schwechat processed 4.39 million.
