The board of directors of Spine-Tech Inc said Wednesday it approved a shareholder rights plan to protect the company from unsolicited attempts to acquire the company.
The company said the plan is not in response to a specific takeover threat.  
"(T)he company has no knowledge that anyone is considering a takeover of the company," Spine-Tech said in a release.
Under the plan, the company will on September 10 distribute as a dividend one right for each share of the company's common stock. Each right entitles the holder to buy one-hundredth of a share of a new series of preferred stock.
The right can be exercised only if a person or group acquires 20 percent or more of the company's common stock or announces a tender or exchange offer. It expires on September 10, 2006.
