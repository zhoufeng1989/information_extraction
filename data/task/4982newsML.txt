AT&T Corp. and the Debis unit of Daimler-Benz AG are planning to form a consortium to bid for the E2 cellular phone licence in Germany, a weekly magazine said Wednesday.
According to a report in the Wirtschafts Woche business magazine, Debis, AT&T and its European partner Unisource NV are working on a bid for the licence, which will be awarded next year.
AT&T was not immediately available for comment and a spokesman for Debis called the report speculation.
The report was released ahead of publication on Friday.
Industry observers have long thought it likely that Debis would make a bold step into the telecoms arena ahead of liberalisation of the sector in 1998.
Although it does not operate a network of its own, Debis' Debitel unit is Germany's biggest mobile telephone service provider, with 700,000 customers under contract.
AT&T and Unisource, an alliance of telecommunications companies from Sweden, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands, are also forming a fixed-wire network venture with Mannesmann.
They will jointly buy a stake in DBKom GmbH, the communications subsidiary of railway Deutsche Bahn AG.
