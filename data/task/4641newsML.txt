Indonesian tobacco tycoon Putera Sampoerna through his investment holding company Miel Investment Corp has raised its take-over offer for Transmarco Holdings to Singapore $8.55 from S$6.50, Standard Chartered Merchant Bank said on Tuesday.  
An statement from Standard Chartered Merchant Bank said Miel Investment Corp, whose director is Jonathan Sampoerna, has agreed to buy one million Transmarco shares at Singapore $8.55.
Standard Chartered, together with Swiss Bank Corp, are acting for Miel Investment, which is wholly-owned by Sampoerna. The Sampoerna family controls cigarette maker PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna.
As a result of the purchase of the last lot of shares, Miel Investment will have to revise its price for all shares in its conditional takeover offer for Transmarco from S$6.50 to S$8.55.  
Miel Investment now owns a total of 9.84 million shares in Transmarco or 35.77 per cent of its issued share capital.
Standard Chartered said the offer remains conditional on the company eventually holding at least 13.75 million Transmarco shares or more than 50 percent of its issued share capital.
Transmarco shares were suspended at midday on Tuesday and were last traded at S$9.80, up S$0.95.
