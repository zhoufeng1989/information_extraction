Privately-owned Qatar Airways will take delivery of its fourth Boeing 727 next week, chief executive Sheikh Hamad bin Ali bin Jabr al-Thani said on Wednesday.
"The used aircraft was purchased last month. It is coming next week," Sheikh Hamad told Reuters, adding that it was bought from General Electric Co's leasing subsidiary General Electric Capital Aviation (GECAS).
He did not give the cost of the new plane.
The 727 will bring the two-year-old carrier's fleet to six -- four 727s and two 747s. Sheikh Hamad said the airline had in June sold its third 747 to a private buyer.
The airline has long-term plans to increase its fleet.
"We are planning to take the narrow-bodies up to six and also add a freighter. We are actively in the market discussing with various leasing companies," he said.
"It continues our plan to make Doha one of the important air locations in the Gulf," he said.
