NOTE - Full name of the German Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG. The company said the effects of its rescue by banks and creditors, carrying forward losses from 1994 and drawing down reserves would completely offset the 1995 loss.
These measures were also responsible for allowing the company to report a profit in the first half of 1996. Excluding the special effects of the 928.7 million mark rescue plan, KHD made a loss of 108.9 million marks in the first half of 1996.
It said this result was better than expected. Particularly in the motor division earnings continued to improve, it said.
The company said it expected group sales in 1996 to match the previous year. It gave no figures. It added that with the effects of cash aid totalling more than 800 million marks it was aiming to achieve break-even this year.
