ValueVision International Inc said on Thursday it had signed a cable affiliation agreement with Tele-Communications Inc.
Under the pact, TCI will provide ValueVision with some 340,000 "must-carry-equivalent" homes in Seattle and other markets, as well as a minimum of 4.0 million part-time homes in other TCI markets.
TCI may provide "must-carry equivalent" homes for ValueVision's Seattle broadcast station in other markets while it completes previously-scheduled rebuilds of its Seattle system, ValueVision said.  
A ValueVision spokeswoman said "must-carry equivalent" homes refers to the number of homes an operator is obligated to send television signals to, and does not refer to specific homes.
The company said connections serving about 70,000 Seattle homes will begin airing ValueVision's broadcast station (KBGE-TV, Channel 33) as soon as possible.
Another 270,000 ValueVision replacement homes and markets may be selected at TCI's discretion, and will launch within six months.
ValueVision's new part-time carriage on TCI systems will begin by November and will reach a minimum of 4.0 million homes on a part-time basis, generally expected to be concentrated during overnight hours.
