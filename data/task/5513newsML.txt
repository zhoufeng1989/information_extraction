Stock in Pangea Goldfields Inc made solid gains on Wednesday after releasing an update on its Peru gold project.
Shares were up C$0.95 to C$7.60 by early afternoon, a gain of more than 14 per cent. Almost 600,000 shares traded hands.
The results are preliminary but encouraging, said Pangea president Jean-Charles Potvin.
"Given the fact that everywhere we sample, we get good results, it looks very promising," he said.
"So we'll have an aggressive drilling program as soon as we can move the rig in."  
Results released Wednesday showed the Pucamina Shear, a mineralized structure on its Victoria project in Peru, may be mineralized over a strike length of two kilometres, the company said.
Trench P18 and P19 returned grades of 7.3 grams of gold per tonne over eight metres and 23.2 grams per tonne over 3.7 metres respectively.
Trench P25 returned grades of 5.6 grams per tonne over three metres. Trench P6 showed 3.95 grams per tonne over three metres, the company said.
