Amway Corp has cancelled its private network distribution agreement with Tee-Comm Electronics Inc and its subsidiary AlphaStar Television Network Inc, the satellite communications company said Wednesday.
Tee-Comm and Alphastar said they were holding talks with Amway to set up a new contract.
An AlphaStar spokeswoman said the service was put in operation but Amway cancelled it because they were unhappy with it. The official would not give details on what Amway was displeased with.
"The issues and problems raised by Amway in the past have been rectified," AlphaStar president Murray Klippenstein said in a statement.
Tee-Comm and AlphaStar signed a contract a year ago to provide Amway with hardware and a broadcasting system so Amway could communicate with its more than one million salespeople, the spokeswoman explained.
Amway was involved in the testing of the program and problems that arose during the testing have been solved, she said.
She said she would not give details since the matter was now in the hands of lawyers.
