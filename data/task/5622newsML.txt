Centura Banks Inc said Wednesday it had reached an agreement to buy CLG Inc, a privately-owned company that specializes in leasing computer and technology equipment.
Centura, which did not reveal the terms of the agreement, said CLG would operate as a subsidiary to complement its lines of business and create financial synergy.
It said the company, based in Raleigh, N.C., would remain independent of its leasing division.
Centura said the purchase was the second recent venture outside its traditional financial services. Last month, it signed an agreement to acquire a 49-percent stake in First Greensboro Home Equity Corp, a mortgage lending company with offices in 31 states.
