Chilean electricity generator Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (Endesa) is studying plans to build a copper refinery in northern Chile, reported newspaper El Diario Wednesday.
"We believe that the mining sector has a certain synergy with the electricity business and the idea is to participate in projects with an intensive use of this material, as is the case of refineries," said general manager Jaime Bauza.
But any investment in the mining industry would be marginal to the company's power generation activities, he said.  
"Never will more than five percent of Endesa's assets be outside electricity generation," said Bauza.
Chile, the world's largest copper producer, has seven refineries which can process up to 1.5 million tonnes of fine copper a year, said El Diario.
Copper production is rising steeply with copper in concentrate output expected to grow to 3.4 million tonnes by the end of the decade from 2.1 million tonnes this year.
Most of the concentrates are shipped abroad for processing in foreign smelters and refineries.
