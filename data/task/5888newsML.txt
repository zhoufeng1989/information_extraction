The prime minister of the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius said on Wednesday Indian firms were interested in forming joint ventures with Mauritian businesses in the local information technology sector.
"It's very important to have transfer of technology to Mauritius," Ramgoolam told reporters at news conference on his return from a week-long trip to India.
"I strongly believe that the state, via the prime minister, gives a global orientation and the private sector follows by seizing opportunities created," Ramgoolam said.
As international trade liberalisation gathers momentum, Mauritian manufacturing firms are seen in a need to boost their competitivity through investment in a capital intensive base.
Diversifying the manufacturing base into other sectors such as information technology is one option being contemplated.
The Mauritian manufacturing base, through a free Export Processing Zone (EPZ), was the principal engine behind the country's economic turnaround in the second half of the 1980s.
Export of manufactured products, mainly textiles, is the country's largest hard currency earner in gross terms. EPZs account for about 70 percent of Mauritian total annual exports.
Mauritius exports totalled 25.8 billion rupees ($1.3 billion) in 1995, up from 23.2 billion rupees in 1994.
($1=20.35 Mauritian rupees).
