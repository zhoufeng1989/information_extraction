Portugal's Financial Markets Committee (CMVM) has suspended share trade in Banco de Fomento & Exterior, a spokesman for the Lisbon bourse said.
The suspension followed an announcement from the Finance Ministry that it would give a news conference at 1300 GMT on the privatisation of the bank.
The government has received three offers for the 65 percent of BFE it is offering at the privatisation, although no details have been given on pricing.
The stock was suspended at 2,545 escudos per share.
