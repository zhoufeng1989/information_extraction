C-MAC Industries said on Wednesday it has sent a letter to shareholders of Circo Craft Co Inc advising it would not amend its C$9.50 per share takeover offer for the company.
C-MAC, a make of advanced electronic components said in the letter that as Circo Craft's recent earnings did not show an increase it believed the offer was adequate.
C-MAC also said the offer represents a premium of 38 percent over Circo's market value at the time of the offer.  
Circo, a maker of circuit boards, was trading under C$7 before the bid was announced by C-MAC on August 1. After the bid, the stock jumped on hopes of a bidding war or a sweetened offer by C-MAC.
Circo was off C$0.05 at C$10.10 while C-MAC was down C$0.35 at C$6.50 in early afternoon trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday.  
Circo Craft's board of directors recommended on August 19 that shareholders reject the bid and also disclosed that several other companies had entered into confidentiality agreements to review Circo's operations.
But C-MAC said its shareholders' letter that it was "surprised" at certain statements by Circo's board when itrejected the offer, including:
- CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Inc would recieve additional compensation if a superior offer was forthcoming.
- that the company would risk the long term value of Circo Craft by opening its books to other interested parties.
C-MAC said the offer will expire, as previously announced, on August 30.
Circo earlier reported that its earnings fell to C$0.16 per share, or to C$2,438,000 in the second quarter from C$0.15 per share, or C$2,400,000 in the year ago period.
