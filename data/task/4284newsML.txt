FoxMeyer Health Corp said Tuesday it had signed a definitive agreement to sell its distribution subsidiary to an investor group led by William Taggart for $25 million in cash and securities.  
Under the agreement, the private, New Jersey-based investor group will acquire all of the common stock of FoxMeyer Drug Co from FoxMeyer Corp, a subsidiary of FoxMeyer Health.
FoxMeyer will receive $10 million cash upon closing, expected on or before October 19, and a $15 million, five-year note convertible into a 15 percent interest in the common stock of the new entity, FoxMeyer added.
The investor group and Neuman Health Services Inc have reached an agreement in principle for a joint venture to manage and operate FoxMeyer Drug, FoxMeyer said.
