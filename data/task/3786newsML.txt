NeoRx Corp Tuesday said the Food and Drug Administration licensed Verluma, a monoclonal antibody-based imaging agent used to determine the stage of disease in patients with small cell lung cancer.
In a statement, the company said it earned a $4.5 million milestone payment from the Dupont Merck Pharmaceutical Co, a venture between DuPont Co and Merck & Co Inc. DuPont Merck will market and distribute Vermula in North America and pay NeoRx royalties on sales.
