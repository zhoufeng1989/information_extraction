Nedlloyd NV said a small rise in second quarter net profit from ordinary operations to 21 million guilders from 18 million was achieved despite deteriorating ocean shipping rates.
Nedlloyd said its European Transport and Distribution sector, offshore drilling unit Neddrill and other activities all performed better than in the second quarter of 1995.
Ocean Shipping profits fell two million guilders to 22 million in the second quarter, despite a 16 million guilder profit on the sale of vessels. Freight rates slipped and currency movements cost the company 10 million guilders.  
However, Nedlloyd said ocean shipping results had improved compared with the first quarter as a result of cost cuts, a slight increase in volumes and a more profitable cargo mix.
Second quarter profits from European Transport and Distribution -- which groups road transport and non-ocean shipping units -- rose two million guilders to 10 million.
Nedlloyd's German joint venture road transport unit, Unitrans, posted improved results as did North Sea Ferries.
However, the performance of the Benelux distribution service Van Gend & Loos and pan-European road transporter unit Nedlloyd Road Cargo FTL/Specials declined.
