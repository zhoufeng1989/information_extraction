NGC Corp said Thursday it had reached an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission staff to sell its interests in certain fractionation assets in Texas.  
NGC said the agreement was part of the commission's review of its pending merger with Chevron Corp 's Natural Gas Business unit and Warren Petroleum.
It said it would sell its 80 percent interest in the Mont Belview I fractionation facility as well as its ownership of the Mont Belview II fractionation facility, known as Gulf Coast Fractionators. The company would nevertheless retain a 38.75 percent interest in the plant at Belview II, it added.
NGC said the commission still had to approve the agreememt it had reached with its staff before it could merge with the Chevron unit August 31.
Its shareholders are to vote August 30 on the merger, a cash and stock deal that would combine NGC with practically all of Chevron's midstream assets and natural gas and gas liquids marketing business.
