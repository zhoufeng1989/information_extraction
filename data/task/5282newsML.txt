The loss-making North American trucks division of Swedish vehicle maker Volvo AB will break even in the first half of 1997, Volvo Trucks managing director Karl-Erik Trogen said on Wednesday.
"Our losses in North America will narrow in the first half of 1997. Some time during the first half of next year we will arrive at zero in our operating result," he told Reuters in an interview.
Volvo trucks operating result weakened sharply in first-half 1996 to 1.08 billion crowns from 2.94 billion. Trogen said a weak market and lower sales in north and south America were behind the fall.
