India's state-run refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) said it planned to build a liquified natural gas (LNG) facility in India in partnership with Total S.A. of France.
An HPCL official told Reuters a team of officials from both companies were looking for a suitable port-based location for the project.
She said the normal capacity for an LNG terminal was 2.5 million tonnes.
"We have signed an addendum to our earlier MOU (memorandum of understanding) with Total to include development of LNG projects," the official said.
HPCL and Total recently signed an MOU for floating joint ventures to build liquified petroleum gas (LPG) infrastructure and related facilities in India.
HPCL's new LPG import terminal at Mangalore with a capacity to handle 600,000 tonnes a year is scheduled to be commissioned next month, HPCL chairman H.L.Zutshi told reportes on Tuesday.
The company is also building LPG import facilities at the Vishakhapatnam outer harbour, Zutshi said.
