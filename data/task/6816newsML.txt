-- Smith Barney analyst Reijer Lenstra confirmed he raised his rating on BioChem Pharma Inc to outperform from neutral, saying he had become more bullish on larger cap stocks which he said had corrected since April.
-- In company-specific news, he said that the granting of a U.S. patent on BioChem's 3TC AIDS drug to Emory University was now discounted in the stock price.
"Now the Emory patent has been anounced and it's old news. It is being discounted in the stock price," Lenstra said, adding that the stock had lost six points late in July after the granting of the patent was announced.
-- Shares were down 5/8 at 34-7/8 in late morning trading on Wednesday.
