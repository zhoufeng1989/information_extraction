NorAm Energy Corp said on Wednesday its NorAm Damage Prevention unit received a three-year, $12 million contract to locate underground utility lines for eight Arkansas utilities.
The agreement covers more than 80 percent of all utility line locating in the state, NorAm said.
Customers or businesses who plan to dig underground notify utilities through their local NorAm One-Call Center 48 hours in advance, NorAm said. NorAm Damage Prevention locates the lines and marks them for customers and businesses, it said.
