UK mobile phone group Orange Plc offered what it described as a "cautionary note" on the extent of incentives it is likely to need to offer new subscribers in the second half.
Orange's subscriber acquisition costs, which make up a large part of overall group expenses, fell some nine percent to an average 269 stg per subscriber in the first half of the year, a performance it said it might not be able to repeat.
"We're putting a little cautionary note in here. We might do better, but don't always count on it in the second half of the year," group managing director Hans Snook said in an interview.  
Competition among the U.K.'s four mobile networks is likely to intensify in the latter part of the year up to Christmas, with often large incentives on offer to attract customers.
Snook noted however that he could not be certain that subscriber acquisition costs would need to rise because if mobile handset prices were to fall of themselves, the level of added discount could afford to be lower.
Orange said earlier its cashflow from operating activities before subscriber acquisition costs was now positive.
