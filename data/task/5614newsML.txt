Campbell Soup Co said on Wednesday that it will weigh various options on restructuring its operations now being studied by the management consulting firm Coopers & Lybrand.
Spokesman Jerry Buckley said the report, which began in early May, is nearing completion and will review various growth strategies, including the possibilities of a staff reduction, plant closures and the brand divestitures, but added that there were no definite plans.  
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in Wednesday editions that the company is considering a plan to reduce its staff in its headquarter in Camden, New Jersey and to close one of the four major soup plants.
The newspaper also said the company was considering divesting brand names including Swanson frozen foods.
