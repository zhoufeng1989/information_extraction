Swedish industrial investment company Incentive is considering the sale of its Hagglunds Vehicle unit and its holding in U.S. component maker Wabco, a company spokesman said on Wednesday.
"We haven't started the sales process yet but it's fairly high up on our list of priorities," information director Bengt Modeer told Swedish business daily Finanstidningen.
He said Incentive would not be a strategic owner in Hagglunds Vehicle in the long term.
"It's in the development unit and does not belong to our central business areas," he said.
Modeer declined to comment on who the buyers could be but said both Swedish and overseas defence corporations could be interested.
Hagglunds makes tracked vehicles for military purposes.
"We're also looking at our holding in the American (component manufacturer) Wabco. With such a large holding we'll have to pull out gradually or in some other way," Modeer said.
In total, the sale of Hagglunds Vehicle and Wabco could bring in over a billion crowns to Incentive, he said.
