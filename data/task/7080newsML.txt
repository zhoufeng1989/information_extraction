Swedish forestry group MoDo AB said on Wednesday it expected current negotioations on newsprint prices to end with lower prices.
"The discussion is not directly about price increases. It will probably lead to a moderate decrease but it is not a question of a collapse," MoDo CEO Bengt Pettersson told a news conference.
He said prices were under pressure from cheap North American supplies and also spoke of lower European consumption.
"Deliveries fell by five percent (in Europe in the first half) and I think this is a combination of cost cutting and destocking. We have seen that in the USA and there is no reason to believe things will be different here," he said.
