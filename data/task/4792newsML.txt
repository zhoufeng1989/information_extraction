Hotel and property group Pioneer Industries International (Holdings) Ltd said on Tuesday it plans a rights issue to raise funds for property investment projects in the United States, Thailand and China.
"The funding proposal is at a preliminary stage and the terms of such proposal... have yet to be determined," it said in a statement.
It did not say how much it intends to raise.
Pioneer posted a 28 percent rise in yearly profit to HK$84.85 million last week.
