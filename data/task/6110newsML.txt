Argentina will select a financial consultant to advise the government on the privatization of the country's 57 airports on August 26, a top official said on Wednesday.
Kleinwort Benson, Salomon Brothers, UBS and Coopers and Lybrand were chosen in the pre-qualifying bids for the consultancy contract, Miguel Velarde, adviser to the official in charge of the airports sale, told Reuters.
"The winner of the contract will advise on the form of the privatization," said Velarde.
One of the main issues the consultancy will advise on is whether or not the 57 airports will be sold in one batch or whether there will be more than one concessions, for instance splitting Buenos Aires' main international and main domestic airports in two.
President Carlos Menem has stated he wants the concessions for the airports to be sold by January. The investment necessary to bring the airports up to scratch would be about $1.65 billion. The concessions will last for 25 years.
