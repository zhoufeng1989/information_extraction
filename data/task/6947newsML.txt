Harris Savings Bank said it had revised downward its second-quarter and first-half earnings because of violations of internal controls and unauthorized activities.
In a statement on Tuesday, the savings bank said net income for the quarter ended June 30 was $186,000, or $0.02 a share, down from the previously reported $2.7 million, or $0.25 a share.
Earnings for the first half were revised to $1.9 million from the previously reported $4.4 million.  
"Harris reported in a Form F-3 dated and filed Aug 2, 1996 that management, on July 22 and 23, 1996, confirmed violations of internal control policies and certain unauthorized external activities concerning its relationship with a mortgage brokering company," the company said.
"A preliminary estimate of the amount of funds involved in the unauthorized external activities and violations of internal control policies was previously reported as between $3.5 and $5 million," it said.
"... Harris ceased purchasing loans originated by the mortgage brokering company and no longer provides table funds for loans originated by the mortgage brokering company. Also, Harris has taken possession of certain assets of the mortgage brokering company."
The mortgage brokering company was unnamed.
Harris said part of the loss might be recovered from various sources, including insurance.
"Harris management does not believe that this non-recurring loss will have any impact on ongoing operations," the statement said.
