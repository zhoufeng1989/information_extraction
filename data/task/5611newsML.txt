Bonneville Power Administration's chief executive officer on Wednesday told California utility commissioners that the problems faced by the power grid in the western U.S. were not fully understood.
Chief Executive Randy Hardy told the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) that keeping power capacity finely balanced with the needs in the West has been especially hard this year because of a combination of high river flows at hydroelectric plants and high temperatures in the region.
