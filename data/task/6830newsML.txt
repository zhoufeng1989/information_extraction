Scott Paper Ltd said on Wednesday that it reached an agreement in principle with Kimberly-Clark Corp regarding trademark and technology licensing and transition issues.
Once formalized, this deal will give Scott Paper Ltd access for 10 years to most of the brands and technology it has licensed from Kimberly-Clark Tissue Co, formerly known as Scott Paper Co (U.S.).
Scott Paper Ltd will also be granted the time and flexibility to transition those brands which will be returned to Kimberly-Clark earlier than in 10 years.
On April 18, Kimberly-Clark announced it planned to sell its 50.1 percent stake in Scott Paper Ltd.
Scott Paper Ltd and its advisers will therefore now seek a purchaser willing to make an offer for 100 percent of the company, Scott Paper Ltd said.
"I am delighted to announce we have an agreement-in-principle on the most significant business issue which arose out of the acquisition of Scott Paper Co by Kimberly-Clark Corp in December 1995," Lee Griffith, president & chief executive of Scott Paper, said in a statement.
