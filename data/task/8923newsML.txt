ML Direct Inc has changed underwriters as well as terms of its planned initial public offering, according to underwriter Patterson Travis and regulatory filings.
The company originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in May for an offering of one million shares at an estimated price of $7 each in an IPO to be underwritten by I.A. Rabinowitz. The company still listed Rabinowitz as its lead underwriter in an early June filing.
In August, ML Direct refiled for an offering of 480,000 shares to offered at $15 each with Patterson Travis as the new lead underwriter. Both underwriters confirmed the change but did not give a reason for the switch.
Patterson Travis said the deal has been submitted to regulatory officials and said trading could begin sometime next week.
ML Direct "expands market opportunities" for products marketed on direct response television such as infomercials and television shopping networks.
The company has proposed to trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol "MLDR".
