United Meridian Corp said its Watson 2 well in the Bear Grass area of the Cotton Valley Reef Trend in east Texas encountered more than 200 feet of net natural gas with porosity as high as 15 percent.
The well, drilled to a depth of 15,300 feet, was cased and temporarily suspended without testing pending completion and the start of production in the fourth quarter of 1996, the Houston-based independent oil and natural gas company said.
United Meridian said it holds a 27.5-percent interest in the discovery in the Cotton Valley Reef play, one of the most active U.S. onshore exploration areas.
The company has an average 30-percent working interest in 3,500 acres in the Bear Grass area and plans to drill at least two additional reef wells in 1996 there, it said.
The company recently began three-dimensional seismic surveys under a joint venture on 200,000 acres to the north of Bear Grass, where it holds a 30-percent working interest.
