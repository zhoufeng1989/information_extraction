Greek state railways firm OSE is considering issuing samurai bonds, underwriting sources in Tokyo said on Wednesday.
Some OSE officials told Japanese underwriters that the railway company was considering raising funds in the samurai market, sources said.
"The OSE started to collect necessary information from Japanese underwriters on Friday...and it is possible that it will pick the lead manager for the deal soon," one source said.
The OSE is hoping to raise about eight billion yen for maturities of 15 years or longer, sources added.
