NOTE - Pathe, which has stakes in BSkyB, Canalsatellite and other media interests, was set up from the split of diversified conglomerate Chargeurs  CHGP.PA SA into two quoted companies in June. Pathe said in a note in the BALO legal bulletin that the rise in second-quarter sales was due mainly to Renn Productions and AMLF, fully consolidated in January 1996, and Pathe Holland, purchased at the end of 1995.
It said the 1995 proforma comparisons had been reconstructed from the published accounts of Chargeurs SA.
