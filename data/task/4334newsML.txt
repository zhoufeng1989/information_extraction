The Austrian unit of Swedish furniture retailer IKEA said on Tuesday it planned to open two new outlets in Austria within the next two to three years.
Company spokeswoman Silvia Losert told Reuters IKEA Austria was looking to build new stores in northern Vienna and the western city of Innsbruck to complement the country's existing three IKEA stores.
"Plans for the buildings themselves do not yet exist but we have concrete plans to build them," spokeswoman Silvia Losert told Reuters.
No details of the planned investment in the new stores were immediately available.
Losert said the Innsbruck site had already been purchased, but the company was still looking for an appropriate site in northern Vienna. She said the Innsbruck sales floor would cover an area of 9,000 to 10,000 square metres. No details of the future Vienna outlet were available.
