DBS Investment Research said on Wednesday it recommended investors reduce their holdings of shares in Singapore department stores group Robinson & Co Ltd.
The advice, in a note to clients, follows the announcement by Robinsons on Tuesday of a 10.8 percent fall in its 1995/96 net profit to Singapore $25.34 million.
