The second phase of the privatisation of Banco de Fomento & Exterior (BFE) does not appear on the agenda for Thursday's cabinet meeting, a government spokesman said.
But the fact that the issue was not included on the formal agenda did not mean that it would not be discussed, he added.
Investors are waiting for a government decision on the outcome of the bidding for the state's 65 percent holding in BFE.
The candidates are Banco Portugues de Investimento, Banco Finantia and Banco Nacional de Credito Imobiliario.
BFE stock gained around one percent to 2,530 escudos in lively trade of nearly 620,000 shares as investors continued to speculate about the likely price of the privatisation.
