NOTE - French insurance company Axa said in a statement consolidated first half revenues rose 24.5 percent. It said the increase primarily reflected the consolidation of Australian insurer National Mutual during the period.
On a constant currency and structural basis, consolidated revenues rose by 8.8 percent.
The company said first-half 1995 figures had been restated to take into account the favourable impact of new French accounting rules.
The elimination of catch-up on coinsurance and acceptances on group life business -- life and non life -- under the new accounting rules had resulted in double counting of the 1994 and 1995 premiums in 1995. To make the 1996 figures comparable, the 1995 figures were restated.
