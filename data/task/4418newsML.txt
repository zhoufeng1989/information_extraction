Shareholders of Swiss temporary employment firm Adia SA approved a merger with French-based Ecco SA, to create a new firm Adecco SA.
Shareholders voted in favour of the move at a special annual general meeting by approving a capital increase for Adia.
Adia said it had been offered 98 percent of Ecco's shares for cash or swap, paving the way for replacing Ecco stock with old and new Adia capital under the name Adecco.
