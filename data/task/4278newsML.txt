Consolidated Edison Co of New York Inc (Con-Ed) has shut its 975 megawatt (MW) Indian Point 2 nuclear power station at Indian Point, N.Y., the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) said Tuesday.
The NRC, in its daily status report, said the unit was in "hot shutdown," which typically indicates systems at the plant are being kept on standby in anticipation of a relatively prompt restart.  
No further details on why the unit went off line or when it likely would return to service were not immediately available.
