Shares in British Gas Plc are expected to open higher after the publication of the latest price proposals for its transportation arm Transco from industry regulator Ofgas, traders said.
The proposal for a 20 percent reduction in transportation charges in 1997/98 and 2.5 percent thereafter compare with initial proposals for cuts in a range of between 20 and 28 percent in 1997/98 followed by five percent cuts thereafter.  
Ofgas said the proposals could lead to a cut in average domestic gas bills of almost 30 stg in 1997, rising to over 50 stg in 2001.
"It's a bit of a curate's egg. British gas have clearly lost out in year one. However, Spottiswoode has made significant concessions in subsequent years which gives British gas a far better chance of holding their dividend," said Yamaichi analyst Nigel Hawkins.
In early pre-market trading British Gas shares were 11-1/2p higher at 209-1/2p.  
Analysts said the initial 20 percent cut was as good as could have been expected, with most not having expected any concessions from Ofgas director Clare Spottiswoode.
But on the whole the review was seen as beneficial with the better-than-expected change in the RPI-minus formula for later years slightly outweighing the hefty year one cuts.
"Spottiswoode has moved quite significantly on the RPI-minus number (for) subsequent years and it is a well-enough pitched proposal conceivably to split the British Gas board on how to respond to it," said Hawkins.
