Kellwood Co said Thursday its sales for the first quarter ended July 31 declined four percent to $327.4 million from $340.6 million due to lost volume from operations that were closed or sold.
Volume was also lower from businesses that were consolidated and restructured in the second half of the last fiscal year.
It added that consumer demand for apparel remains relatively weak.
"Kellwood has responded by taking a number of steps to improve our competitive position during a soft retail ennvironment," chairman William McKenna said in a statement. "These steps include reducing overhead, more effective sourcing, and a better product mix."
He added that Kellwood, which makes and markets apparel, also has several programs and initiatives that are expected to show results in the fiscal third quarter.
"As the second half of fiscal year 1997 unfolds, we should increasingly benefit from the refocused merchandising and sourcing strategies in the restructured business units," McKenna said.
