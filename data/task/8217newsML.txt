BP America's catalytic cracker at its Lima, Ohio refinery will likely be down for at least two more weeks, an Ohio environmental regulator said.
"They're speculating about two weeks. I think it's more their sense. I don't believe they really know," said a regulator with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency referring to BP America estimates.
The cracker was shut last Thursday due to a fire, and traders have said the unit will be out 10 more days.
But BP America, a unit of British Petroleum Co Plc, declined to comment on the status of the cat cracker.
Gasoline traders noted Midwest gasoline prices have been especially strong in the wake of the outage.
Crude traders said BP's Lima unit was out selling prompt crude, linking the sales to the loss of overall capacity.
The cat cracker, with a capacity of 38,500 barrels per day (bpd), was shut after a fire broke out last Thursday at the base of the cat cracker unit.
The Lima refinery has an overall capacity of 155,000 bpd.
