Japanese photographic film maker Konica Corp said on Tuesday it had agreed to sell two of its main film developing laboratories in the United States to Qualex Inc, a subsidiary of Eastman Kodak Co.
Qualex, based in North Carolina, is the largest film developing company in the United States.
A Konica spokesman said the labs were in Connecticut and Virginia. He declined to give a value for the planned sale. The sale was part of Konica's restructuring, the spokesman said, adding that Qualex wanted to expand its network of film developing labs.
