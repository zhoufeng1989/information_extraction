United Airlines has ordered $4.4 billion worth of airplanes from Boeing Co. and Europe's Airbus Industrie, with the the lion's share going to Boeing Co., the airline announced Thursday.  
United ordered 27 jets -- 19 jumbo 747-400s, six 757s and two 777s -- valued at about $3.5 billion from Boeing and 24 Airbus A319s valued at $900 million.
The UAL Corp. unit is the first U.S. airline to order Airbus's latest model, United and Airbus said.
The order values quoted by United are based on manufacturers' list prices, the airline said.
"United benefited from substantial discounts to the prices from both manufacturers," it said.
