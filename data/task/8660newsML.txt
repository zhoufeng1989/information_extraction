MDC Communications Corp, after reporting a second-quarter loss, said on Thursday it still expected substantial year-over-year gains in earnings for 1996.
The marketing and communications firm said, however, that third-quarter results would be no better than break even. MDC said the third quarter was traditionally its weakest period.  
"Our major gains are budgeted for the fourth quarter and we expect to achieve them," MDC President Miles Nadal said in a statement. "This will result in substantial year over year growth in earnings per share for the fiscal year ended December 31."
MDC reported a second quarter loss of C$0.04 per share against a profit of C$0.10 per share in the year ago period.
The company said the loss in the second quarter was due to seasonality of Regal Greetings & Gifts sales and one-time costs from the integration of House of Questa.
