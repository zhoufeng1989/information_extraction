Earlier on Thursday, the Blue Square Chain Investments & Properties Ltd, in which Blue Square-Israel owns 66.35 percent, reported earnings.  
Blue Square-Israel president and chief executive Yacov Gelbard said in a statement that investments in new and existing stores amounted to 122 million shekels in the first six months of 1996.
"During the first half of 1996, Israel was again plagued by high inflation -- 7.0 percent versus 2.5 percent during the same period of 1995. As a result, our gross margin declined from 25 cent to 25.4 percent," he said.
"On the plus side, inflation eased financial income during the first half of 1996. So our margin on pretax income, excluding gains from the exercise of warrants, improved from 4.3 percent to 4.6 percent."
The company is the largest retailer in Israel in terms of sales volumes and number of stores, operating 118 supermarkets and 26 department and specialty stores.
