Dutch shipping and road transport group Nedlloyd NV said on Wednesday it did not expect to make a loss from ordinary operations in full year 1996.  
"The recovery of results in the ocean shipping sector strengthens the executive board in its confidence that we will not make a loss for the whole of 1996," the company said.
Nedlloyd said its forecast did not take into account extraordinary gains.
The unpredictability of market developments, especially in container shipping, made it impossible to make a precise forecast of 1996 results, it added.  
Nedlloyd earlier announced a 291 million guilder net profit for the second quarter of 1996, boosted by an extraordinary gain of 273 million, from a 19 million profit in 1995's first half.
Net profit including extraordinaries for first half of 1996 was 276 million guilders, compared with 96 million a year ago.
The company's first half net profit from ordinary operations was six million guilders, down from 38 million a year earlier, with second quarter profits up to 21 million from 18 million.
The extraordinary gain comprised a book profit of 247 million guilders on the sale of the Neddrill unit and a 26 million guilder refund from the pension fund.
