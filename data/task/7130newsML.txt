Swedish investment company Custos said on Wednesday it had sold its holding of 2.37 million shares in insurer Trygg-Hansa. The holding corresponds to 2.9 percent of capital and 2.4 percent of votes.  
Custos said in a statement its strategy was to hold "meaningful" stakes in a limited number of larger, and primarily listed, companies.
"Custos has thus disposed of all of its holding in Trygg-Hansa," it said.
The sale would mean a liquidity boost of 271 million crowns and a capital gain of 68 million crowns, Custos said.
