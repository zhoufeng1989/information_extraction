Norwegian offshore group Aker ASA said on Wednesday the topside structure for the Maghogany oil and gas field would sail on Thursday from the Aker Gulf Marine yard in Texas headed for the Gulf of Mexico.
The topside will be secured to the pre-installed jacket, which is fixed to the seabed in 110 metres of water.
The field, operated by Phillips Petroleum Co, is scheduled to begin production later this year.
Aker Gulf Marine, 51-percent owned by Aker, is also responsible for offshore hook-up and commissioning of the platform, with work due to be completed in September.
