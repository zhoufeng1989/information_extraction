The Romanian-American Enterprise Fund (RAEF) said on Thursday it had signed two investment deals in Romania's nascent information technology sector worth around $4.0 million.
"The companies involved are making significant contributions to the development of modern communications and information technology in Romania," an RAEF statement quoted Fund president John Klipper as saying.
The RAEF invested over $1.5 million in Bucharest-based Logic Telecom SA to help finance its electronic mail, Internet connections and remote database access services.
It also pumped more than $2.0 million into  Transdata SA, which designs and builds telecommunications and electric power networks. Transdata will use the money to buy equipment and build new offices.
The latest investments of RAEF -- established in 1994 and funded by the U.S. government -- are part of a broader programme to promote local private sector growth in the ex-communist country.
RAEF previous deals included investments in companies specialising in printing packaging, newspaper printing services, garment making and agriculture services, the statement said.
A Fund official said previous investment amounted to more than $3.0 million. The Fund aims to support the expansion of the Romanian private sector through profitable investment in small and medium-sized enterprises.
