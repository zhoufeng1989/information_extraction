Biomira Inc and Neoprobe Corp said on Tuesday they signed a deal under which Biomira granted Neoprobe an exclusive worldwide license to use Biomira's radiolabeled murine monoclonal antibody MAb-170 in Neoprobe's RIGS technology for surgical detection of breast cancer.
Neoprobe plans to conduct a Phase I clinical trial involving up to 45 women who are undergoing breast conserving surgery, the company said.
Roughly 73,000 cancer patients have this type of surgery every year in the U.S. and that number is expected to rise to more than 87,000 a year in the next 10 years.  
In Neoprobe's RIGS approach, the Biomira antibody is injected into the patient before surgery.
It then attaches to the cancerous tissue and the surgeon uses Neoprobe's hand-held gamma-detecting probe to identify where the antibody has accumulated in diseased tissue which may not have been recognizable by touch or sight.
Neoprobe has received an upfront fee and will get milestone payments and royalties upon commercialization of a RIGS product using the Biomira molecule. Neoprobe has the option to license another Biomira molecule, MAb-174.
