Clal Israel is offering to buy up to 21.59 percent of Clal Trading, currently held by the public, at 8.75 shekels a share, which is 37.4 percent above the market price on August 21, Clal Israel said in a statement to the bourse.
Clal Israel, which already holds 78.41 percent, said it would buy the entire 21.59 percent should it get offers for at least 90 percent of the shares outstanding.
A spokesman for Clal Israel said the move was part of the company's strategy towards greater efficiency and to reducing the number of holding companies it owns. It also controls Clal Industries.
Clal Israel is one of Israel's leading business conglomerates with interests in industry, construction, trading and insurance.
