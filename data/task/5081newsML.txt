CSR Ltd said it was close to patenting a process that will lead to a range of new products and applications for a by-product of its cane sugar production.
"In new technology, CSR has combined with James Cook University in north Queensland which will lead to a range of new (sugar-based) products and applications," CSR senior technical officer Chris Allen told the Sugar 2000 conference here.
"We hope to have a patented process in the very near future," he said.  
Allen did not disclose what products were planned but said there was a growing trend in the world towards natural waxes for use in a wide range of food and chemical additives.
"We believe sugar cane wax has the potential to be the best (food) wax in the world," he said.
Allen told the conference Australian sugar mills were "fast approaching the point where it is very difficult to justify mill expansion on returns generated from sugar alone."
Sugar mills next century will find more uses for their sugar cane, he said.  
"The mill will be a multi-function mill, producing a whole range of products. Sucrose may eventually be a small component compared to the others," Allen said.
Cuba already prduced 28 products based on sugar cane other than raw sugar, Allen said.
"How will the Australian industry respond?" Allen asked.
He said current sugar extraction processes were "fundamentally flawed."
CSR had conducted trials on processing and cleaning of middle fibres in cane with the clean pith an excellent source of human dietary fibre, Allen said.  
Fibre components, molasses and sucrose all had further uses in a range of products, he said.
"There are big opportunities in ethanol from bagasse as a fuel extender," Allen said.
"The use of sucrose as a fermentation medium for very high value low-volume products offers enormous potential for the future," Allen said.
