UK automotive distributor Evans Halshaw Holdings Plc on Thursday said its sales in the all-important August market are marginally ahead of last year, with pressure remaining on margins.
"The group has increased the emphasis it places on the control of used car stocks throughout this period and believes it is well placed to successfully manage the traditionally more difficult final quarter of the year," Evans Halshaw said in a statement.
The company said it continues to move ahead with plans for enlarged marketing territories with most of the major manufacturers.
Evans Halshaw reported first-half 1996 pretax profits fell to 7.3 million stg from 8.2 million stg a year-ago. Turnover rose to 455.4 million stg from 430.4 million last year.
