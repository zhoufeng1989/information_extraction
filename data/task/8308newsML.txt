Andover Togs Inc said it had reached an agreement with The CIT Group/Commercial Services, Inc for a two-year $15 million revolving credit facility.
The company said in a Wednesday statement that the agreement, which is subject to final documentation, is expected to be completed this week and submitted for approval by the Bankruptcy Court.
Upon approval by the court, this new facility will replace the company's existing $11 million credit facility which is due to terminate in December 1996.
The maker of children's wear filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on March 19.
