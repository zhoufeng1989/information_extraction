BASF AG said on Wednesday it was still keen to make acquistions in the pharmaceutical sector, but added it would move cautiously because of the current high prices for any takeover prey.
"We are looking at opportunities,...but we are not exactly trigger happy," said executive chairman Juergen Strube, without elaborating. "Right now we have nothing that can be communicated," was all he would say further on the subject.
BASF last year bought the pharma business of Boots Plc, which was a major contributor to profit growth in the first half of 1996.
But Strube said that chemicals would remain BASF's major activity.
He said BASF, which sees big oppurtunities in Asia, will boost its chemicals operations through investment of over two billion marks by the year 2000.
BASF expects total 1996 capital expenditure in tangible fixed assets to be 3.2 billion marks, of which 50 percent will be invested outside Germany.
The German group forecast 1997 capital expenditure of about 3.7 billion marks.
