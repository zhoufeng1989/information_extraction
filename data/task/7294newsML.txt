Indonesia's PT Inti Indorayon Utama said on Wednesday it was considering acquiring the chemical assets of PT Riau Andalan Pulp and Paper and selling Indorayon's power plants to boost efficiency after a recent weak performance.
"We are considering acquiring the chemical assets of Riau Andalan and selling the power plants of Indorayon in an effort to increase efficiency," corporate secretary P. Daritan told Reuters.
Inti Indorayon and Riau Andalan belong to New York-listed Asia Pacific Resources International Holdings Ltd (April) which has its administrative office in Singapore.
Daritan said the firm expected the purchase of the chemical assets, used in the production of pulp and paper, to strengthen its chemical division.
He said the plans were expected to materialise next year, but declined to give further details, saying Indorayon was still calculating the figures.
The efficiency effort was neccessary following the firm's weak 1996 first-half results, he said.
