Taiwan's Yang Ming Marine Corp said on Wednesday that the firm and Japan's Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha had signed a joint slot exchange agreement with China's China Ocean Shipping Global Co.
The agreement, which came right after China issued rules governing direct shipping links with estranged Taiwan, would allow them to cover trade between North Europe and Japan, China and Asia, Yang Ming said in a statement.
