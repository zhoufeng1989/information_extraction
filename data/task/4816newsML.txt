Trading and telecommunication company Transmarco saw 720,000 shares crossed early Tuesday morning between Singapore $6.75 and S$8.00, dealers said.
The share price continued to surge in early trading after news over the weekend that Indonesian tycoon Putera Sampoerna would make a conditional takeover offer at S$6.50 per share.  
At 0127 GMT, Transmarco shot up S$0.65 to S$9.50 on volume of 1.35 million shares, including the crossed deal.
"It's a cornered stock with no big sellers. If the price had been pushed to S$13.50 before, it can happen again," said a dealer.
