Analysts and investors came out of a presentation by Paul Walsh, chief executive of GrandMet's U.S. packaged food subsidiary Pillsbury, in a positive mood.
Some headed off to tinker with their forecasts slightly but most tended towards moving the stock from a hold to add or buy. Many already had buy recommendations in place. "I think we have come away well satisfied with the progress Pillsbury is making," said Panmure Gordon analyst Phillip Shaw. "Our view is, fundamentally, the image of the company is definitely improving." The shares hit a high of 485p in early trade ahead of the meeting before falling back on profit-taking.  
Analysts at Hoare Govett and Cazenove are said to have turned more positive on the stock but were not immediately available to comment.
The market consensus for GrandMet's full year 1996 results hovers somewhere around the 980 million stg mark and about 1.06 billion for 1997.
"I think they demonstrated quite clearly that the progress they are making on food is sustainable," said Charles Winston, drinks analyst at BZW.
