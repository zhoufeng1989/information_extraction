Aegon NV's 1996 first half net profit is expected to rise by some 12 percent to 690 million guilders, according to a Reuter poll of nine analysts.
Analysts said the Dutch insurer's increased stake in Scottish Equitable would help boost first-half earnings which are due to be reported on Thursday.
Aegon raised its stake in Scottish Equitable from 60 to 80 percent from January 1, 1996 and will further increase it step by step to 100 percent by the end of 1998.
"The market in Britain is improving and Aegon is getting a larger portion of Scottish Equitable's profit," said Jean-Paul van Bavel of Van Lanschot Bankiers.
"The profit contribution from Scottish Equitable is steady," he said, adding that Aegon's unit was performing better than most of its competitors in the improving British market.
Analysts also mentioned the modest recovery of the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling as an extra boost for Aegon's first-half earnings.
The life sector, from which stem 80 percent of Aegon's earnings, is still growing strongly and analysts said the non-life sector was showing signs of stabilising.
"Aegon does not depend much on non-life business," Van Bavel said, adding that the climate had turned more favourable in this cyclical sector.
Several analysts said they foresaw Aegon's profits growing at the same pace in the second half of 1996 as the 12 percent or so expected for the first six months.
Analysts said Aegon's new German investment operation Moneymaxx, set up from scratch in late 1995, was probably not yet profitable.
Dick Erdman of brokers Gilissen said Aegon would probably have to sink some 50 million guilders into Moneymaxx this year to establish a position in the competitive German market.
