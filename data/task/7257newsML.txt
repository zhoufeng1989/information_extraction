Brisbane-based heavy engineering group Evans Deakins Industries Ltd (EDI) said on Wednesday it had acquired 91.1 percent of the shares of Clyde Industries Ltd following its successful offer for Clyde, and would now move to compulsory acquire the outstanding stock.
"The company intends issuing notices to acquire those shares when the current offer period expires on September 9, 1996," EDI said in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX).
EDI's bid for Clyde, a Sydney-based engineering firm specialising in the railway sector, valued the Clyde at about A$180 million.    -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
