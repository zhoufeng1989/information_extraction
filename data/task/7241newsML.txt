Woodside Petroleum Ltd said on Wednesday repair work would cause crude oil production from its Cossack offshore operation to be reduced by more than half to about 50,000 barrels a day for three weeks in September.  
The curtailment in output would result from the shutdown of the operation's gas export system, a Woodside spokesman told Reuters.
The spokesman said the operation had been mostly producing crude oil at or above its rated capacity of 115,000 barrels a day in recent weeks.
"We're looking at a three-week shut down of the gas export system in September... during that period oil production would probably have to be cutback to around 50,000 barrels a day," the spokesman said. "There is no reason why between now and September we can't maintain full production," he said.  
"We are at the moment capable of maintaining full production," he added
In order to prolong the life of a new dehydration component of the vessel, the repair work is required to rectify faults causing an excess moisture problem, the spokesman said.
"When you shut down the gas export system it means that we have to flare any gas that comes up associated with the oil. Because of limitations on the amount of gas we can flare, we have to reduce oil production accordingly," the spokesman said.  
The joint venture partners in the operation are currently reviewing the repair work, which is likely to occur in the last three weeks of September, the spokesman said.
"We could carry on with constant interuptions to the system, but it's much better to bite the bullet and try and rectify the problem completely," he said.
Equal partners in the field are Woodside, Japan Australia LNG (MiMi) Pty Ltd and units of The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, British Petroleum Co Plc, Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch/Shell Group.  
Woodside shares were 2.0 cents up at A$7.72 by 1.25 p.m. (0325 GMT).
