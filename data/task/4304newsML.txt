Sprint Corp is expected to enter the race to make the Internet as widespread for customers as the telephone, The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.
The telecommunications giant, which has 15 million customers and nearly $13 billion in annual revenue, plans to announce on Tuesday a new Internet-access service for consumers, a Sprint executive said.
Though Sprint has been operating a major portion of the Internet since 1992 to serve businesses, the Kansas City, Mo., company has yet to target residential customers, a move that many industry watchers have been waiting for.
The move follows those by several other telecommunications companies that have set their sights on the Internet, ranging from regional Bell operating companies to MCI Communications Corp and AT&T Corp.
Sprint will roll out its service in phases. Beginning on Tuesday, the company will invite 200,000 of its residential long-distance customers to use the service for free until it is made available to the general public in the autumn.
Like its rivals, Sprint will ultimately charge users $19.95 for unlimited monthly usage. Users can also opt for a pay-as-you-go plan whereby they would not pay for a month of service if they did not use it.
Sprint executives expect their service will be used by 20 percent of the Internet's customers with a year, although they decline to quantify that number.
