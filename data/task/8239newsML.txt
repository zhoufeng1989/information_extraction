Rinker Materials Corp said on Thursday it plans to modernize and expand its Miami cement plant, replacing its current wet process production equipment with a new dry system.
The dry process uses modern equipment and controls to provide a more environmentally sound and cost efficient production method, the company said.
The project will increase the plant's annual cement production capacity from 640,000 tons to one million tons at a cost exceeding $100 million and should begin operation by the end of 1998, the company said.
