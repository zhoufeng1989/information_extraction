    Nedlloyd	  38.10   Robeco Effectenbank
COMMENT: Buy
Q2 figures much better than expected, particularly due to recovery of ocean shipping. "In the longer run, we expect that capacity expansions will again put pressure on the results of Ocean Shipping. However, for the good short term prospects, we rate the share as a Buy for the time being."
