BankSA said on Wednesday it had cut rates for its range of fixed-rate home loans by between 0.25 and 0.50 percent for fixed terms of between one and five years.
The bank cuts its two year fixed rate by 0.45 percent to 8.50 percent.
BankSA managing director Terry Jay said the bank had taken advantage of positive pre-Federal Government budget expectations in money markets to secure lower-cost funds and was passing the benefit to its customers immediately.  
This was despite rates in the financial markets moving up by 10 to 15 basis points since last night in a reaction to the budget, he said.
The new rates were effective for all new fixed-rate owner occupier and investment loans from August 22, he said.
