South Korea's Samsung Aerospace has been working on a plan to take over bankrupt Dutch airplane maker Fokker NV within a few weeks, the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf reported on Wednesday.
The newspaper said Samsung met with representatives from the Dutch Economics Ministry and Fokker's receivers in the Hague on Tuesday to discuss the plan.
It said the South Korean firm was interested in taking over the whole of Fokker, including the parts already sold to Dutch industrial systems group Stork NV. Samsung first declared its interest before Fokker collapsed in March.
Fokker went bankrupt on March 15, ending 77 years of aviation history, after a trail of heavy losses led its Daimler Benz parent to cut its cash lifeline late in January.
Stork purchased Fokker Aviation, the profitable services and maintenance arm of the bankrupt plane maker, in July for 302.5 million guilders. But the deal can still be reversed if Stork is unwilling to co-operate with a future buyer of Fokker's bankrupt aircraft manufacturing unit.
