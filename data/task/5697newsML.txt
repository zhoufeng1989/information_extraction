WALNUT CREEK, Calif., Aug. 21 - Maxis Inc said Wednesday it has delayed the release of its new version of the popular software, SimCity, to mid-1997 from a previous early 1997.
In a statement, the company said SimCity 3000 needs "further enhancements" before being shipped.
"The delay will help to ensure that every aspect of SimCity 3000 meets the expectations consumers have for this product," said Sam Poole, chief executive. "The Sim brand is the cornerstone of the Maxis franchise and we will not compromise its quality."
Maxis shares were off 15/64 to 11-33/64 by mid-afternoon.  
The new SimCity 3000, a video game, will incorporate the latest 3-D design and mini-simulation.
Though the new SimCity's launch will be pushed back. Maxis said it is on track to launch four titles, SimCopter, SimGolf, SimPark and SimTunes, in time for holiday shoppers.
"Releasing these new products simultaneously should allow us to command greater consumer attention during what is traditionally the heaviest buying period of the year," Poole said.
A fifth, The Streets of SimCity, is expected to be released in the first half of 1997.
SimCopter enables players to fly through cities that they build and perform various missions. SimGolf allows golfers to "play" the greens, change courses or design their own course.
The Streets of SimCity permits players to drive, or race, through cities of their own creation.
Children's titles include SimPark, in which players plan and build outdoor nature parks and SimTunes, which lets kids explore and experience the relationship between music and art.
