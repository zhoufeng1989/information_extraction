Hydro-Quebec said on Wednesday that it agreed with Nordion International Inc, a unit of MDS Health Group Ltd, for the production of cobalt 60 at its Gentilly-2 nuclear power station.
The five-year agreement, which runs from 1997 to 2002, provides for the production of between 15 and 20 million curies of cobalt 60 and will generate millions of dollars a year in revenues for Hydro-Quebec, the Quebec government-owned utility said.
A previous five-year agreement with Nordion (1985-1989) for the production of 18 million curries of cobalt 60 had not been renewed because of an oversupply situation. Cobalt 60 is a radioactive isotope of cobalt 59 that results from the irradiation of cobalt 59 in a nuclear reactor. The production of cobalt 60 has no effect on the output or safety of the reactor, Hydro-Quebec said.
Cobalt 60 is used for treating cancer, sterilizing medical and surgical products, preserving food, combating food-borne illness and decontaminating waste. Nordion supplies more than 80 percent of the global demand for cobalt 60, Hydro-Quebec said.
