Chrysler Corp said it would announce plans on Tuesday for a new manufacturing investment in South America in conjunction with Detroit Diesel Corp.
The two companies gave no details of the investment, but a Chrysler spokesman said it was being made in addition to the $100 million assembly plant project that Chrysler is currently building in Argentina.
Industry analysts said the project was expected to be in Brazil and was likely to include diesel engines for a light truck for the Latin American market.
Detroit Diesel owns VM Motori SpA, in Centro, Italy, which produces diesel engines for Chrysler minivans and Jeep Grand Cherokee minivans built in Graz, Austria.
VM Motori technology may be adapted for a Chrysler-built vehicle for Latin America, said Michael Robinet, managing director for CSM Forecasting in Farmington Hills, Mich.
Such a vehicle could use the company's Jeep Grand Cherokee platform or its front-wheel-drive Neon car platform, he said.
Chrysler said its chairman, Robert Eaton, would hold a news conference at 1100 EDT Tuesday at company headquarters, along with Detroit Diesel Chairman Roger Penske.
