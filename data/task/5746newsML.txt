ValuJet Inc on Wednesday declined to comment on a news report which said renewed service would include flights to Washington Dulles and three Florida cities -- Orlando, Tampa and Fort Lauderdale.
The discount carrier, which has yet to win approval from the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration, said earlier in the day that it would miss a planned target date for resuming operations, set for Friday.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that ValuJet employees were told the four destinations would be among the first five to be serviced once federal approval was gained.
