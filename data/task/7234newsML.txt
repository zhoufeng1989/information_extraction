The Warehouse said on Wednesday it would begin stocking AEG's range of appliances.
"We have been looking for some time to source a world class appliance range, that would offer our customers real value for money," managing director Stephen Tindall said.  
The managing director of New Zealand's distributor of AEG appliances, Kent Baigent of Kent Baigent Group, said he had also been searching for an innovative way to make their German engineered AEG Appliances more accessible to a wider range of New Zealand consumers.
New Zealand customers were increasingly demanding both higher quality and lower prices.
AEG as one of the foremost brands in Europe is well known for its high performance and quality, and the buying volumes will allow The Warehouse to supply AEG Appliances at the lowest prices ever offered by AEG in New Zealand.
