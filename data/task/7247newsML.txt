Caltex Australia Ltd said on Wednesday that benefits from the merger last year with Pioneer International Ltd's Ampol Ltd enabled it to declare an interim dividend of 11 cents per share.
"The benefits of the merger of petroleum refining and marketing assets of Ampol and Caltex in May 1995 are now emerging in a tangible form and these benefits enable this interim dividend payment to be met from the current profit, Caltex chairman Malcom Irving said in a statement.
