H&R Block Inc, which offers tax and financial services, said its loss for the fiscal first quarter was due to anticipated increases in expenses associated with compensation, rent and utilities.
Incremental operating costs and amortization of goodwill from tax businesses acquired in fiscal 1996 also increased expenses for the quarter.
H&R Block reported a net loss from continuing operations of $0.27 a share. A year ago, it had a net loss from continuing operations of $0.20 a share, which included a one-time gain realized on the MECA Software Inc sale and the write-down of certain impaired assets.
H&R Block said its tax services business typically reports losses in the first three quarters. "While most of the revenues for the tax business are generated in the fourth quarter, certain expenses remain year round," Frank Salizzoni, interim president, said in a statement.
Revenues from H&R Block Tax Services' U.S. operations rose nearly 22 percent to $9.6 million in the quarter. Revenues from international tax operations increased more than 29 percent to $2.7 million. Revenues for Block Financial Corp increased nearly 31 percent to $8.2 million.
