Arco Pipeline Co set crude oil shipments on California's Line 63 at 46.81 percent of nominations for September, a spokesman said Wednesday.
The apportionment rises from 41.27 percent of nominations allowed in August, with daily throughput forecast at 110,000 barrels.
Volumes of light and heavy crude shipments were not immediately available.
Shipments on the line have been restricted almost every month since a January 1994 earthquake shut a companion line into Los Angeles, causing congestion.
Arco Pipeline Co is a unit of Atlantic Richfield Co.
