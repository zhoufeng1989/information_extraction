Swedish truck maker Scania denied on Wednesday a German magazine report that it is negotiating with Germany's Volkswagen.
"We are not involved in any discussions with VW. Our only cooperation is that we market their products -- VW, Porsche, Seat and Skoda -- in Sweden," Scania spokesman Lars Christiansson told Reuters.
"Manager Magazin" reported on Tuesday that Scania and VW were negotiating on joint production of a middle-sized truck.
