(At)Home Corp, a developer of high-speed interactive Internet services via the cable TV infrastructure, said it had signed partnership deals with more than 60 TV, print media and Web content providers.  
(At) Home, with the backing of several top U.S. cable companies and Silicon Valley venture fund Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers, plans to introduce a proprietary Internet delivery network running over existing cable infrastructure.
The company said it had signed up suppliers of news, sports and entertainment programming, including CNET Inc , CUC International, Wired Ventures Inc, Knight-Ridder Inc, New York Times Co, SportsLine USA Inc, Gannett Co Inc Dow Jones & Co Inc and Softbank Corp's Ziff-Davis.  
"We feel these news services are the harbingers of a new wave of breakthrough offerings on the Internet," said Charles Moldow, (At)Home's vice president of media developer.
The (At)Home network would connect personal computer users to the Internet using high-speed cable modems running over this network, unlocking the possibilities of a high-speed, graphics-intensive programming delivered via the Internet.
Current modems running at slower speeds are capable of transmitting text and simple graphics, but this method is ill-suited for more data intensive voice, video and graphics.
To date, however, the closely watched Internet technology pioneer has experienced substantial engineering difficulties in attempting to overlay its Internet network on the existing cable infrastructure, resulting in service roll-out delays.
The company now says it plans to introduce its service in selected markets later this year through its three cable service operator partners, Tele-Communications Inc, Comcast Corp and Cox Communications Inc.
