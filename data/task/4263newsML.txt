Sprint Corp said on Tuesday that it chose Netscape Communications Corp to provide the World Wide Web browser for its newly launched Internet service, Sprint Internet Passport.
Sprint said it will also include Netscape Navigator in its retail Internet systems, and said Netscape will feature Sprint as an Internet service provider in Netscape's retail Internet systems.
Sprint, already the world's largest carrier of Internet traffic, according to the company, said its service will include the Navigator software, access speeds up to 28.8 kilobits per second (kbps) and a rebate certificate for a 28.8 kbps modem, and local dial access in 212 U.S. cities.
A pricing plan was not announced.
The announcement moves Sprint into an arena already occupied by AT&T Corp and MCI Communications Corp, as well as several regional Bell operating companies.
