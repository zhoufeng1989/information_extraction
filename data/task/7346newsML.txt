Fuji Photo Film Co Ltd and Nikon Corp said on Wednesday that they would launch a new model of their digital camera on September 2 at a much lower price than the existing version.
The new version, which is also aimed at the professional market, will cost 890,000 yen, compared with 1.1 million yen for the previous model introduced in February 1995.
A Fuji spokesman said the price cut was a result of mass production.
The new model will also be twice as fast was the old version, the spokesman said.
About 3,000 of the cameras were sold in the last year, and the spokesman said sales of the new version were expected to be higher.
