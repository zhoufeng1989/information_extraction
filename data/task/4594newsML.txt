Note: The consolidated results were unaudited. PT PP London Sumatra Indonesia is among the largest plantation firms in Indonesia.
The company said the results had exceeded half year net profit projections of 27.30 billion rupiah made earlier this year.
It said the increase was largely due to higher crude palm oil prices and a decrease in operating expenses.
Lonsum said the net realised price for crude palm oil for the period was $498 a tonne compared with $459 used in projections.
It said declines in operating expenses were due to consolidation of sales, marketing and management functions.
The firm said the full impact of higher prices on revenue was dampened by a decrease in sales of rubber due to unseasonal wintering and rain.
It said the change in wintering patterns meant that rubber production and hence sales should be higher than expected in the second half of this year.
Rubber sales fell by 11 percent to 7,561 tonnes against projections and 24 percent against the same period in 1995.
It said the firm achieved planted hectarage of 6,261 hectares of palm oil and 1,930 hectares of rubber. It said it was part due to the extended wet season in south Sumatra.
The firm said it was confident of meeting the full year forecast for 1996 of 73.09 billion rupiah.
It said 48.0 percent of crude palm oil production for the second half of 1996 was already sold forward at an average price of $542 as well as rubber being hedged at an average price of $1,335 per tonne.
