Northwest Airlines Inc said Thursday it signed a cooperative marketing agreement with Mahalo Air which will include code-sharing on flights in the Honolulu-West Maui and Honolulu-Molokai markets.
The code-share service with Mahalo, a Hawaii-based carrier, will be effective September 15. Northwest has an existing cooperative agreement with Hawaiian Airlines Inc.
Northwest's flight code will be published and sold on Mahalo's daily service between Honolulu and Kapalua, West Maui, and between Honolulu and Molokai.
The code-share service is valid for connections at Honolulu to and from cities served by non-stop Northwest flights, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Minneapolis/St. Paul and, in Japan, Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya and Fukuoka.
