Swedish industrial investment group Incentive confirmed on Wednesday media reports that it was mulling the sale of its Hagglunds Vehicle unit, but added a decision was not imminent.
"It's not a new story, strategically the unit does not belong to our core business," Incentive spokesman Bengt Modeer told Reuters, adding that the company would now concentrate on developing businesses such as its wholly-owned drugs unit Gambro.
Modeer said Incentive was not in a hurry to dispose of the military vehicle operation but would wait for the right buyer and the right price.
"We want to sell to a good new owner, it doesn't matter whether it's Swedish or not, as long as our criteria are met," he said.
Incentive also plans to dispose of its 35 percent interest in U.S. brake component manufacturer Wabco acquired through the purchase of former investment group Cardo.
"It's a profitable and well-run company, but we came over the holding through the Cardo deal, which was just a way of getting at the Gambro holding," Modeer said.
