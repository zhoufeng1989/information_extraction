IBCA, the European credit rating agency, said on Thursday it assigned a short-term rating of A1 plus and a long-term AA minus to CIBC Wood Gundy Plc (CWG).
"CWG is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), the second largest bank in Canada," IBCA said in a statement.
"It was created in December 1995 when the former CIBC Bank plc acquired the equity and Eurobond operations of Wood Gundy London branch and the corporate loan business of CIBC London branch and then changed its name to CIBC Wood Gundy Plc."  
"The reorganisation was designed to create a UK-based banking operation able to conduct banking and securities business anywhere in the European Union.
"All CWG's obligations entered into prior to October 1999 are fully guaranteed by CIBC. Because of the guarantee, we have assigned to CWG the same long-term and short-term ratings as CIBC," IBCA said.
