Poland's largest insurer, state-owned  Powszechny Zaklad Ubezpieczen SA (PZU), netted 52 million zlotys in the first half of 1996, 18 percent more than in the same period last year, PZU said on Wednesday.
PZU said in a statement its gross profit reached 98 million zlotys over the six months, compared with 66 million zlotys in the first half of 1995.
Gross premiums increased by 43 percent to 2.1 billion zlotys in the first half of the year, while the company paid out 906 million zlotys in claims, PZU said.
PZU, a virtual monopolist before the fall of communism in 1989, is slated for privatisation, which its management wants to see started late this year.
It will begin to face serious foreign competition in 1999, when Poland is scheduled to fully open up its market to foreign insurance companies.
