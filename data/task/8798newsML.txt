NOTES:
(a)  The Company emerged from protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on September 11, 1995. "Effective Date"). Consequently,  the Company has applied the reorganization and fresh-start reporting adjustments to the balance sheet as of September 2, 1995, the closest fiscal month end.
(b)  Due to the losses it generated, the Predecessor Company was in a net operating loss carryforward position.  
Further, the discharge of debt in conjunction with the reorganization did not generate taxable income. Consequently, no provision for income taxes was recorded by the Predecessor Company. The proforma income tax provision for the Predecessor Company has been computed at the estimated combined Federal and state tax rate of approximately 40%.
