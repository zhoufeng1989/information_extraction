Niagara Mohawk Power Corp (NIMO) said Wednesday it plans to restart its 610 megawatt (MW) Nine Mile Point 1 nuclear power station later today.
"We're on schedule to start up later today. It usually takes about 24 hours before it goes on line," said company spokesman Alberto Bianchetti.  
The unit shut down Aug 18 to repair a feedwater pump, he said. Feedwater pump problems have been interrupting operation of the plant since Aug 8.
Nine Mile Point produces about three percent of NIMO's electricity deliveries. The utility provides power to about 1.5 million customers in upstate New York.
