Shares in UK life assurance and pensions giant Prudential Corp rose on Thursday amid market talk that the group may soon dispose of its Mercantile & General (M&G) reinsurance arm.
The stock was up 18 pence at 443p by 1439 GMT in good volume, with over 11.6 million shares traded.
Prudential said in June that it planned to float part of M&G on the stock market and use the proceeds to fund the acquisition of a life assurance company or building society.
But analysts said it may still opt for a trade sale if a buyer came along at the right price.
Swiss Re, the loser in the battle for American Re which was bought by Munich Re earlier this month, was cited by some analysts as a potential buyer.
However, others noted M&G would not amount to a substitute for American Re. M&G is a life reinsurer, while American Re operates in the U.S. property and casualty reinsurance market. Trading volume in Prudential shares has been heavy over the last few days, with 7.6 million changing hands on Wednesday and 9.5 million on Tuesday.
Moderate demand for Prudential call options also helped sentiment in the cash market on Thursday, market makers said.
