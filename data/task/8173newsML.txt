Tosco Corp said on Wednesday that an early morning fire at its Bayway, New Jersey, refinery did not affect operations.
"It was really a non-event," said Dwight Wiggins, president of Tosco Refining Co, a unit of Tosco Corp.
But the news gave a slight lift to energy futures prices during overnight ACCESS trade in New York, brokers said.
Wiggins said the fire was small and quickly extinguished.
It broke out in the refinery's crude unit.
No workers were hospitalized.
The refinery processes 230,000 barrels of crude oil daily.
