IBCA, the European credit rating agency, said on Thursday it affirmed Banca Commerciale Italiana's ratings at a short-term of A1 plus, a long-term of AA minus, an Individual of B/C and a Legal of 2.
"The bank has performed well in comparison with other large Italian banks, showing higher profitability and sound asset quality," IBCA said in a statement.  
"Although loan loss provisions rose in 1995, the parent bank sees fewer new bad debts arising in 1996.
"Increased diversification into South America via an enlarged holding in Gruppo Sudameris has proved satisfactory, and has helped to raise the group's net interest margins. For 1996, Banca Commerciale Italiana expects slightly higher net income," IBCA said.
