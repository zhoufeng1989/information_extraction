British Airways shares dropped on Tuesday after a newspaper report said the UK was not prepared to sign an "open skies" agreement with the United States similar to the one struck between Germany and the U.S. earlier this year.
The share price slipped nine pence to 529p by 0941 GMT in relatively light volume of 1.76 million shares traded.
The Financial Times said the UK felt the deal with Germany was biased towards the U.S., which is due to resume talks with Britain in Washington next week on a new aviation agreement.
The U.S. government has made any approval of a proposed alliance between British Airways and American Airlines conditional on getting on getting open skies with Britain.
But some analysts said the fall may have been overdone.
"I don't think it's the final position at all," said one.
He noted that British Airways was unlikely in eny event to go ahead with the proposed merger with American if it did not make commercial sense.
