Unocal Corp said Wednesday it began to restart its Rodeo, Calif., coker this morning following a three-month shutdown to repair the fire-damaged unit.
"The operations department will have the unit at full rate on (August) 22," a company spokesman said.
A fire in May halved the coker's 52,000 bpd production.
The Bay-area refinery processes around 77,000 barrels of crude oil daily.
Operators this morning began the 22-hour process of feeding the coker fuel oil to convert into other products.
