Financial services group Internationale Nederlanden Groep NV (ING) said on Thursday that earnings growth in the second half of this year would not match the 27.9 percent earnings growth of the first half.  
"It is not to be expected that the percentage increase in group profit for the first half of 1996  will be equalled in the second half of 1996," it said.
Despite an increase in the number of shares in issue, ING said it expected earnings per share for the whole of 1996 to be higher than in 1995.  
"...based on current perceptions and the results achieved for the first six months of 1996, profit per share for 1996 will be higher than the 1995 level," it said.
ING reported that first-half 1996 net profit rose 27.9 percent to 1.51 billion guilders. Net profit per ordinary share rose 21.8 percent to 2.12 guilders.
First-half pre-tax insurance profit rose 16.8 percent to 1.16 billion guilders while first-half pre-tax banking profit rose 39.2 percent to 1.02 billion guilders.
