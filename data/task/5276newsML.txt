Swedish forestry group MoDo AB Wednesday reported sharply lower first-half profits due to weakness in its main markets except for newsprint.
First-half profit after financial items slid 36 percent to 1.66 billion crowns ($251.7 million) from 2.61 billion ($395.8 million). MoDo said currency hedging had improved its result by 948 million crowns ($143.7 million).
Analysts had expected a profit of about 1.44 billion crowns ($218.3 million), and MoDo's shares rose in Stockholm after the news, touching a peak of 188.00 crowns ($28.50) before trading up 4.0 (60 cents) at 185.00 crowns ($28.05).
"The market for pulp, paper and paperboard during the first half of the year was influenced by the general economic slowdown and the current process of destocking in Europe," MoDo said in the results statement.
"However, the order intake for pulp and paper -- for which price increases have been announced -- as well as for paperboard, improved during the second quarter," it said.
Total first-half sales edged down to 10.22 billion crowns ($155.0 million) from 11.61 billion ($176.0 million), as paper, paperboard and pulp deliveries fell 10 percent from the 1995 period to 1.3 million metric tons.
"Compared with the first quarter of 1996, second quarter delivery volumes were up by 88,000 (metric) tons," it said.
Fine paper deliveries in western Europe fell 9 percent in the first half with uncoated grades falling 11 percent. But MoDo said orderbooks at its fine paper mills were now "back to normal" and second-quarter deliveries rose 6 percent compared with the first-quarter.
"The fine paper stocks held by distributors and customers are now estimated to be low," MoDo said. It added that fine paper prices had stabilised and it had announced price increases of some 10 percent to take effect in September.
