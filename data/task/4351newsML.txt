Phoenix airport officials said they foresee an air cargo boom from new non-stop European services from Britain and Germany.
Phoenix Airport marketing director Ann Hastings said cargo has risen 39 percent so far this year and she expected still higher annual growth.
Cargo volumes at Phoenix, the 17th busiest passenger airport in the world, grew 11.3 percent to 286,666 US tons in 1995.
Hastings told Reuters in a telephone interview while on a Germany sales tour: "As we work in Europe to gain more carriers, cargo will grow."
British Airways now flies daily from Gatwick and LTU will start a weekly Duesseldorf to Phoenix in November.
"Cargo has been a small area of our business because freight was trucked to Los Angeles to the freighters for Europe and Asia," Hastings said.
"We know from business clients they want to ship more from Arizona because they would save money and time," she added.
"British Airways has been surprised at the amount of cargo they can get for Phoenix. They have more committed than they can handle."
Companies in nearby Sun Valley include Honeywell Inc, Intel Corp, Motorola Inc and McDonnell Douglas Corp, she noted. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel +44 171 542 7706 Fax +44 171 542 5017
