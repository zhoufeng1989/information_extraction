Thai construction firm, Italian-Thai Development is looking for new projects in Burma such as airport and infrastructure projects, the company president said on Wednesday.
"We're studying the possibility of several projects in Burma. We will be the sole investor in the projects," company president Premchai Karnasuta told reporters.
He declined to elaborate.
Italian-Thai Development is currently building an international airport at Mandalay, 560 km (350 miles) north of Rangoon with investment of $149 million. It is due to be finished by 1999.
"The (Burmese) government is satisfied with our performance on the existing project. There is a high possibility that we will be awarded more projects," Premchai said.
