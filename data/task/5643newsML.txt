The Transportation Department on Wednesday had no comment on when ValuJet Inc might be judged fit to fly again and whether a petition by its flight attendants would slow the review of ValuJet's fitness.
The carrier's flight attendants union asked the department last month to remove ValuJet's top officers because they are either unwilling or incapable of operating a safe airline.
It was grounded on June 11, with the Federal Aviation Administration citing a series safety violations.
Earlier, Valujet said it would not be able to resume operations by its target date of Friday.
