-- Merrill Lynch & Co said it is maintaining its neutral rating on Brazilian steelmaker Acesita following release of the company's first-half earnings and raised its estimates for the firm's projected year-end loss.
-- The bank cited Acesita's worse-than-expected performance in the second quarter and a deterioration in the firm's total debt to total debt plus equity ratio.
-- Merrill Lynch said the firm posted a net loss of 8.4 million reais in the second quarter against a Merrill Lynch forecast for a 2.8 million real net profit.  
-- Slightly lower prices for Acesita's products were mostly to blame for the result, it said.
-- The brokerage also said it has raised its estimate for 1996 losses at the firm to 11.2 million reais from an earlier projection of a 1.2 million-real loss to reflect the poor quarterly performance.
-- "Continued losses from the company's not-flat line also hurt profitability for the quarter," Merrill Lynch said.  
-- It added that a large short-term liability for its participation in CST has appeared on Acesita's balance sheet and has caused "the total-debt-to-total-debt-plus-equity ratio to deteriorate from .27 in the first quarter to .46 in the second quarter."
-- Acesita preferred was down 0.08 reais at 2.35 reais while its voting common was off 0.04 reais at 2.62 reais at 1311 local time/1611 GMT on the Sao Paulo bolsa.
