Consolidated Edison Co of New York Inc (ConEd) said Thursday it still does not have a restart date for its 975 megawatt Indian Point 2 nuclear power plant.
The unit tripped off line late Wednesday for the third time this week.
"When we began restart last night, the plant reacted to a high water level in one of four steam generators," said company spokesman Joan Burger.
"We should have a better idea as to when it will restart later this afternoon," she said.
This latest attempted restart followed a manual shutdown Tuesday when plant operators identified a check valve not operating properly while ramping up from Monday's outage.
The unit automatically tripped off line Monday when a piece of electrical equipment failed.
Indian Point is located along the Hudson River about 50 miles north of New York City.
