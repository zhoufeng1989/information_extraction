Thai Farmers Bank Plc said on Wednesday it had closed its $200 million, 20-year subordinated Yankee bond, the largest issue with the longest maturity ever floated in international markets by a Thai company.
Thai Farmers said in statement that the bond earlier this month had received a BBB-plus long term rating by Standard and Poor's and an A3 rating by Moody's.
The bond carries an 8.25 percent coupon at an issue price of 98.997 percent, representing a 155 basis point spread over the relevant U.S. Treasury bond.
It said the issue, with Merrill Lynch and Co as lead manager, was successfully placed in major financial markets during heightened investor sensitivity to Thailand's political and economic environments.
