The reduction in pulp stocks and an expected increase in consumption should boost white eucalyptus pulp prices this year and in 1997, the president of Portuguese pulp group Portucel Industrial, Jorge Godinho, said.
"We expect the prices of pulp and paper to continue to rise until the end of 1996 and this should continue in 1997," Godinho told Reuters.
He said the sharp drop in pulp prices between the end of 1995 and the first half of 1996 would pave the way for a recovery in prices.
"The fall was so strong between the end of 1995 and the first half of this year that prices could not stay so low," Godinho said without giving specific forecasts.
Analysts quoted by Diario Economico paper said the price of white eucalyptus pulp could rise to 460 ecus per tonne at the end of 1996 from the present level of 420 ecus set on July 1.
