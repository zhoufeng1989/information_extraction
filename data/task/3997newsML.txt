Standard and Poor's said on Tuesday it had assigned its AA minus claims-paying ability rating across the operating entities of the new Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Group.
"At the same time, Standard & Poor's removes the ratings of Royal Insurance Holdings Plc and Sun Alliance Group Plc and units from CreditWatch where they were placed May 3, 1996 with negative implications," the agency said in a statement.  
S&P said the ratings reflected:
-- the strengthened business position of the group in the difficult UK market, and a better spread of activities;
-- potentially improved and more stable operating performance primarily through lower expense levels but also through more diverse sources of earnings, provided the under-performance of the U.S. operation is addressed. The full benefits of the merger will become apparent in 1998 and beyond;
-- very good capitalisation - the merger has achieved a strongly capitalized group without the need for additional leverage.  
"Offsetting this to a degree is the initial disruption to activities that can be expected over the next two years as the new operating structure is implemented," S&P said.
"Management will need to keep close control of the integration process whilst continuing to focus on the longer term strategic direction of the new company."
