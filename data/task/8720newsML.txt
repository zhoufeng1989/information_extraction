Mattel Inc chief executive officer Jill Barad said sales of toys based on Walt Disney Co's "Hunchback of Notre Dame" film would reach $100 million, falling short of "Poconotas" toy sales in 1995.
"It's true that 'Pocohontas' will outsell 'Hunchback,' although we'll do about $100 million in 'Hunchback sales,'" the recently named chief executive told Reuters. Mattel's 1995 revenue from "Pocahontas" was $140 million, analysts said.
Still, Mattel's sales of Disney-related toys this year will top the 1995 total of $450 million, Barad said.
