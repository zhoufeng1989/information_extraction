Shares in newly privatised Kafr el-Zayat Pesticides and Chemicals rose again in heavy trade on Thursday morning amid persistent rumours of one or more attempts to buy control of the company.
Trading opened at 50 pounds a share, three pounds up on Wednesday's close and more than 70 percent above the 29.00 pounds at which the state sold 390,000 shares this month.
They later fell back a little, trading between 47.50 and 50.00 pounds with sudden jumps within that range.
Brokers said they thought several people were trying to win control of the company but they declined to name them.
Broker Ahmed el-Hilw of Hermes Financial said that even without the rumours the unsatisfied demand at privatisation and the company's fundamentals justified a price of 50.00 pounds.
The initial public offering was 55 times oversubscribed.
