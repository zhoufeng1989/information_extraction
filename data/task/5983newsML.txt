Negotiations are reaching their final stage in the sale of up to 75 percent in Polish food retail and wholesale chain  Polski Handel Spozywczy SA (PHS), a Privatisation Ministry spokesman said.
"Negotiations are reaching their final stage," Jerzy Godula told Reuters.
Financial daily Parkiet reported on Wednesday that three bidders out of an original 30 remained in the negotiations -- wholesaler PLI, the Elektromis-Poznanska Szkola Handlu trade school and a consortium of food producers.
Parkiet said PHS, with about 650 wholesale and retail outlets across Poland and more than 6,000 employees, had 549.7 million zlotys in retail turnover last year and 203.3 million in wholesale turnover.
