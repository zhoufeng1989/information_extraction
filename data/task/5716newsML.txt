Tripos Inc said Wednesday it has begun shipping Alchemy 2000, its new version of chemistry research software for personal computers.
The original Alchemy was the first software which allowed chemists to construct visual three-dimensional models of molecules on their desktop computers, Tripos said.
The new version extends market potential to biotechnology and materials science firms, Tripos said. It integrates new custom graphics, database and calculation capabilities.
Alchemy 2000 is priced at $995. Additional modules are available for $595 to $1,795. Upgrades are also being offered.
