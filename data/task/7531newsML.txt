Shares in CS Holding fell in pre-bourse trading after the financial group reported a 20 percent rise in first half profit, less than the rise seen at the other two Swiss banks -- Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) and Swiss Bank Corp ( SBC).
At 0640 GMT the registered shares of CS Holding were quoted at 127.75/128 Swiss francs, down from their 130 previous close. Most other shares were quoted higher.
A dealer said the market was mainly disappointed that CS Holding had not made any announcements regarding the sale of its stake in Elektrowatt or private bank Bank Leu.
CS Holding's six-month result was also in the lower end of expectations, he added.
The market had speculated that CS Holding would use the occasion of the half-year statement to make an announcements about a sale and this would have boosted the shares, he said.
CS Holding has said it intends to sell its controlling stake in Elektrowatt, but that it is under no time pressure to do so.
