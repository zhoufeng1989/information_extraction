Perilya Mines NL said on Tuesday it was confident it would add at least another two years of production to the reserve inventory of its Fortnum gold mine in Western Australia by December 1996.
Drilling work continued to intersect broad widths of high grade gold mineralisation at the newly-discovered Starlight area on the south eastern edge of the Trevis pit, including 15 meters grading 7.46 grams of gold a tonne (g/t) and 29 metres at 5.49 g/t, the company said.  
Perilya in late July said it had hit broad widths of high-grade gold mineralisation in a new area at its wholly-owned Fortnum mine in the Murchison district of Western Australia.
Gold production at Fortnum totaled 68,018 ounces in 1995/96, up 49 percent from the previous year.
At 11:41 a.m. (0141 GMT), Perilya's shares were trading three cents higher at A$0.81 a share.
