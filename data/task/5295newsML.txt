Anglo-Dutch consumer products group Unilever Plc/NV said on Wednesday it was extending its offer period for the shares it does not already own in Lyons Irish Holdings "until further notice".
Unilever acquired a 75 percent stake in the company from Allied Domecq Plc in February. Last week the Lyons Irish board rejected Unilever's 323.3 Irish pence offer to mop up the remaining 25 percent stake as "inadequate".  
Unilever spokesman Tom Gordijn said: "We believe the price is reasonable and fair so we have extended the period that shareholders can submit shares to us...until further notice."
The original offer to shareholders expired yesterday.
Gordijn added that speculation reported in Wednesday's Financial Times paper that Unilever would raise its bid for the outstanding Irish Lyons shares was incorrect.
