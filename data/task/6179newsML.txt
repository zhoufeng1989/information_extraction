News Corp Ltd said on Thursday that the current fiscal year had begun with great promise and a budgeted profit rise of 20 percent for the full year appeared very attainable.  
"From an earnings perspective, the current fiscal year has begun with great promise due to the hit motion picture Indpendence Day, a moderating trend in paper prices and a solid forward book of advertising at the Fox Broadcasting Company (FBC) which will broadcast both the World Series and the Super Bowl," News said in a statement with its 1995/96 profit result.
"A budgeted profit increase of at least 20 percent for the full year currently appears very attainable," it said.  
News said strong performances in U.S. television and U.K. newspapers were offset by lower results at Magazines & Inserts and Book Publishing and Star TV.
"Results from Filmed Entertainment and Australian Newspapers remained virtually flat year on year," News said.
"Throughout the group, higher paper prices increased costs by over US$300 million," it said.
"In associated companies, solid earnings growth at BSkyB and Australian Newsprint Mills were offset by lower results at Ansett Australia and Queensland Press," News said.  
"As a result, the total contribution from associated companies declined by seven percent to A$351 million versus A$377 million a year ago."
News' shares closed up one cent at A$6.47 on Wednesday.
