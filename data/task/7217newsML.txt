Woolworths Ltd said it had executed a A$150 million syndicated working capital facility with Chase Securities Australia Ltd as the agent/arranger.  
"This facility replaces a similar facility taken out at the time of the float of the company in 1993 and which was cancelled at June 1995," Woolworths said in a statement accompanying its 1995/96 results.
Woolworths earlier reported a slight increase in net profit to A$233.6 million in the 52 weeks to June 23, 1996.
