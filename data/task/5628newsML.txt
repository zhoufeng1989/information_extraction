Tellabs and Lucent Technologies said on Wednesday they have signed an agreement to develop ways for their SONET network equipment to be used together in telecommunications infrastructure.
The agreement covers Tellabs' digital cross-connect systems and Lucent's network multiplexers and lightwave systems, the companies said.
Tellabs and Lucent said the agreement gives telecommunications service providers more flexible in developing networks.
