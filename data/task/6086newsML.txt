Telex-Chile SA said its long-distance subsidiary Chilesat SA had finished the paper work and begun receiving funds from a $75 million syndicated loan led by Bank of America.
The loan, announced August 9, has a $65 million five-year portion and a $10 million, seven-year portion, Telex-Chile said in a statement.
The loan, which was well-received in the market and lifted Telex's share price, will allow the company to restructure some of its long-term debt.
