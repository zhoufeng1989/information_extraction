Property concern Asia Standard International Group Ltd said on Wednesday it was planning a US$60 million five-year term convertible bonds issue.
The company said it has invited Merrill Lynch Far East Ltd and Creditanstalt Asia Ltd to lead manage a proposed issue of convertible bonds.
The size of the bonds is expected to be US$60 million with an option granted to lead managers to require the issue of an additional US$15 million bonds, it said.
"The terms of the issue, including the aggregate amount, redemption price, interest rate and conversion terms, have not been finalised but it is currently expected that the bonds will be guaranteed, have a five-year term and be convertible into shares of the company," said chairman Clement Fung in the statement.
The bond is expected to be listed in Luxembourg.
Net proceeds from the bonds are intended to be used for general corporate purposes, it said.
Shares of Asia Standard were untraded at HK$1.54 in mid-morning.
