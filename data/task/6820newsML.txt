The newspapers that belong to the Canadian Press news co-operative have agreed to stay within the agency, Canadian Press said on Wednesday.
CP also said president David Jolley has resigned effective immediately, after seven months on board.
Michael Sifton, chairman of Hollinger Inc unit Sterling Newspapers, will become chairman of CP. Jim Poling, the news agency's vice-president of editorial, will be general manager while CP restructures, the agency said.
Former Southam executive Jim Armitage will work as a consultant, CP said.  
CP said Sifton told employees at the agency's head office in Toronto Tuesday morning that the moves by the board "set the stage for a renewed Canadian Press."
The future of the venerable news agency was cast into doubt earlier this summer when Southam Inc, the largest of CP's 88 members, said it planned to pull out of the co-operative by the end of 1996.
CP's other members were forced to issue notices echoing Southam's because the structure of the organization means that members who remain are liable for all the common expenses when others withdraw.
