The BSA said other housing market indicators look promising for future growth in the market.
"Transactions have been increasing since April and house prices have also been rising, encouraging more sellers into the market," said BSA deputy director general Ron Armstrong.
"However, the severe downturn in the market remains recent history, meaning borrowers are likely to remain careful," he added. As a result, the recovery in the housing market will remain moderate and slower than some commentators have suggested.
