New Zealand's Iddison Group Vietnam Ltd said on Thursday it had agreed with Vancouver-listed gold explorer Olympus Holdings to form a joint venture in Vietnam.
The companies will develop Iddison's Na Pai gold project in the Binh Gia District, Province of Lang Son.
Olympus will buy a right to earn a 51 percent interest in Iddison's mining subsidiary.  
Iddison said it negotiated a production sharing contract over the Na Pai prospect in November 1993 with the government owned Vietnam National Gem and Gold Corp and has been awaiting implementation of the new Vietnamese Mining Law prior to the undertaking significant exploration activities.
The Mining Law was enacted in March 1996 and takes effect in September 1996. As a result of the new law, interest has been renewed in Vietnam's mining potential, Iddison said.
The company's consultant geologist said there was potential for open pit mining. A reasonably detailed exploration programme was warranted to further evaluate the potential.  
Olympus agreed to spend US$1.6 million to earn a 51 percent interest in the Iddison mining subsidiary which holds the Na Pai interest.
Iddison will also be reimbursed US$100,000 and Olympus must spend a minimum of US150,000 prior to withdrawing.
Iddison has granted Olympus a first right of refusal over future mining projects developed by Iddison in Vietnam.
Iddison will also receive 200,000 post reconstruction vend-in shares in Olympus in terms of the Vancouver Stock Exchange Listing Requirements, 500,000 additional vend-in shares upon a bankable feasibility study being prepared and a further  
500,000 vend-in shares in the event that 500,000 ounces of gold are discovered on the property.
