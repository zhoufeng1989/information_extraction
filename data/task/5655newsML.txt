U.S. Office Products said Wednesday that Bankers Trust Co has agreed to extend $500 million in credit, which will be used to refinance existing debt and for general business purposes.
The company previously had a $50 million line of credit.
U.S. Office Products said it will use the increased credit to refinance $180 million of existing debt, which is at a higher cost, at its New Zealand and Australian subsidiaries.
The remaining $320 million will be available for general business purposes, including working capital and acquisitions, the company said.
