Waterhouse Investor Services Inc said on Tuesday that its stockholders overwhelmingly approved a merger with a newly formed subsidiary of the Toronto-Dominion Bank.
About 9.5 million shares, or more than 80 percent of Waterhouse's outstanding shares, took part in the vote. Of those, more than 98 percent voted in favor of the merger, the company said.
The proposed C$715 million merger is expected to be closed about September 16. When it is completed, Waterhouse will join Toronto-Dominion Bank's Green Line Investor Services.
