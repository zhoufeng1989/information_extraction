GPU Generation Inc's 850 megawatt (MW) Keystone 1 coal-fired power plant, near Johnstown, Pa. has resumed full production after shutting down for repairs over the weekend, a company spokeswoman said.
"It came back on line August 19 at 8:14 PM (2014 EDT)," company spokeswoman Jane Oleksak said Tuesday.
The unit, one of two 850 MW units at Keystone plant, was taken off line Sunday to repair a leak in a boiler tube.
Unit 2 is operating normally.
The Keystone plant is operated by GPU Generation, a subsidiary of GPU Inc.
Keystone plant ownership is shared by a group of seven companies, including Baltimore Gas and Electric Co, Delmarva Power and Light Co, PP&L Resources Inc subsidiary Pennsylvania Power and Light Co and PECO Energy Co.
