Israel's Koor Industries Ltd on Sunday will announce the divestiture of one of its holdings, the company's chief executive Benjamin Gaon said.
"We have decided to concentrate on four core businesses and divest from various activities we were in previously. On Sunday we will announce another substantial divestiture," Gaon said at a news conference to announce a joint venture with Sheraton International.
Gaon did not give further details about the divestiture. But Koor has recently sold off holdings in ceramics, footware and mechanical devices.
Koor, which is also traded in New York, is Israel's largest industrial concern.
Its main businesses are in building materials and infrastructure; telecommunications and electronics; and chemicals. It has also started expanding in the tourism and hotels sector.
