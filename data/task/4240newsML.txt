Knape & Vogt Manufacturing Co said Tuesday it expects to improve its financial performance in fiscal 1997 and in the future.
Earlier, Knape & Vogt, which makes shelving and home furnishing and storage items, reported a loss of $0.78 a share after $0.48 in charges for the fourth quarter ended June 30. A year ago, its fourth quarter income was $0.37 a share.
Sales for the quarter were $40.3 million, up from $40.1 million a year ago.
For fiscal 1996, it earned $0.01 a share after charges, compared with year-ago income of $1.40 a share. Fiscal year sales were $163.0 million, down from $168.2 million.
"Although we are disappointed with sales and earnings in fiscal 1996, our recent actions position Knape & Vogt for improved performance in fiscal 1997 and beyond," Allan Perry, president, said in a statement. "We are taking aggressive action to revitalize sales and enhance shareholder value."
The company said one of the early benefits from its restructuring is expected to be an improvement in company-wide plant utilization. It reiterated that annual savings from the restructuring are expected to be about $0.40 a share, spread across fiscal 1997 and 1998.
