Eastern Communications said on Tuesday it had signed 13 agreements worth $40.94 million to sell equipment to the Posts and Telecommunications Bureau of China's northeast province of Heilongjiang.  
The equipment will be supplied from September and will help Heilongjiang add 70,000 more portable phones by the end of this year, the company said in a statement.
In addition, the statement said the firm would be able to obtain 30 million yuan in loans for working capital from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC).
The company has signed an agreement for the money with the Hangzhou branch of ICBC, it said.
Eastern Communications is China's biggest mobile phone maker and is based in the eastern city of Hangzhou. It listed foreign currency B shares in Shanghai earlier this month.
