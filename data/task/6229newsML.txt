California-based, Polar Air Cargo said it will start a new service from Taipei and Singapore to San Francisco and Los Angeles.
Peter Hansen, Vice President Asia, told Reuters in an interview that the twice weekly service to the US west coast on Wednesday and Saturdays will start on September 11. The current service from Taipei and Singapore only has links to the U.S. east coast.
"One aircraft comes into Taipei from Karachi and Singapore with both Californian and east coast cargo on it. Another joins it in Taipei from Sydney in Australia. After swapping any cargo it then goes onto San Francisco and Los Angeles with links to Miami and South America, the other aircraft goes onto Chicago and the east coast," Hansen explained to Reuters.
The carrier said it is using traffic rights it has held for some time for the new service. As on all its services, the airline will use a Boeing 747 with 95 tonnes capacity. --Air Cargo Newsroom tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017
