Showa Shell Sekiyu KK has started to study the possibility of selling oil products to the rest of Asia, a company spokesman said on Wednesday.
The leading Japanese oil refiner and distributor is owned 50 percent by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group.
The Shell group has traditionally asked its subsidiaries to concentrate their business in the country where the unit is located.
It revised that thinking this year when it divided its worldwide operations into four blocks, allowing a certain amount of freedom within each area.
The spokesman said Showa Shell has begun to look into the possibility of selling oil products, such as lubricants, in the growing Chinese market.
The study will be made jointly with the Shell group's Chinese arm.
