    Vendex	    retail	   59.80  ING Barings
COMMENT: Buy (from Hold). Following positive Dutch retail sales figures for the first six months of 1996, we expect a spectacular turnaround at Vendex Food and moderate increase in both sales and results at Vroom & Dreesmann department stores and the firm's speciality stores. Also sustained growth in temporary services. The share buy-back of 4 million common stock should give inspiration. 1996 and 1997 EPS estimates raised.
