India's state-run refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) said it was proceeding with a proposed joint venture refinery on the west coast in partnership with Oman Oil Company.
"We have no advice from Oman Oil on reconsideration (of the project)," HPCL chairman H.L.Zutshi said when asked about reports in Indian media which said Oman Oil was reviewing its commitment to the joint venture.
"As far as we know, their interest in the refinery continues," Zutshi said. "They have already subscribed to a portion of their equity," he said.
M.N. Advani, managing director of Hindustan Oman Petroleum Company Ltd, HPCL's joint venture with Oman Oil, told Reuters that land acquisition for the refinery on the western coast was proceeding smoothly.
"We have full support of the Maharashtra government," he said. The proposed refinery is coming up at Deoghar on the Maharashtra coast.
The refinery will have a capacity to process six million tonnes of crude oil a year.
Zutshi said a preliminary feasibility report on another proposed joint venture refinery in partnership with Saudi Aramco Oil Company has been submitted to the Indian government for approval.
This refinery, also with a capacity to process six million tonnes of crude annually, is to come up in the northern state of Punjab.
