Lukens Inc will shut its stainless steel melt shop and hot-strip mill for one week beginning August 26 due to poor market conditions, a company spokesman said Thursday.
The plant is located in Houston, Pa., near Pittsburgh.
The spokesman said the shutdown will affect about 250 workers. "Some of them will be on vacation and some will be on temporary lay-off," he said.
The company blamed the shutdown on a heavy level of steel imports that have deteriorated pricing in the domestic market.  
The spokesman declined to comment on how the shutdown will affect third quarter earnings.
"We're not going to quantify this or discuss the impact," he said.
Stainless steel imports have increased this year in the domestic market because U.S. prices have been higher than prices overseas.
However, imports have pressured U.S. tags downward. For example, prices for cold-rolled stainless sheet are about 20 percent lower than prices seen last year, the Lukens spokesman said.  
He said operations at the Houston plant will restart September 3.
