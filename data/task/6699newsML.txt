Britain's Gas Consumers Council said on Wednesday that it welcomed an earlier announced price review from industry watchdog Ofgas on British Gas Plc's TransCo pipeline arm.
Ofgas said in a statement that its final proposals could lead to a cut in average U.K. domestic gas bills of almost 30 stg per year in 1997, rising to to over 50 stg in 2001.
"This is regulation with a Robin Hood flavour. Ofgas has now redressed the balance between two million shareholders, who have enjoyed consistent high dividends since privatisation, and 18 million consumers," director Ian Powell said.
However, British Gas has not yet accepted or rejected the proposals and is to hold further talks with Ofgas in order to try and get the price plan amended.
