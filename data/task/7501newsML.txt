Shares in German construction group Philipp Holzmann AG tumbled 3.7 percent on Wednesday, hurt by a disappointing interim report, dealers said.
The shares were the biggest decliners in bourse trading, losing 14 marks to 360 marks. The blue-chip DAX index was down 0.5 percent.
Holzmann had said it expected an operating loss for 1996 and said its output shrank 11.8 percent to 5.9 billion marks in the first six months.
"We had expected an unchanged output figure," said one dealer.
