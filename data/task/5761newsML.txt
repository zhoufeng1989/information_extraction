Florida Power Corp's 825 megawatt (MW) Crystal River 3 nuclear power station is operating at reduced output after problems with a condensate pump, Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) said Wednesday.

The power plant, in Red Level, Fla., is currently operating at about 62 percent of rated capacity, said Florida Power Corp spokeswoman Melodie Hendrix.
"We had to go to 60 percent at that time to stabilize the unit and check out the problem," she said, adding that the company still did not know when they would be able to restore the unit to full production.
The problem, detected about 2215 EDT Tuesday, was traced to two blown fuses in the control circuit that operates the condensate pumps, she said.
"They are deciding how to fix the problem. The plant does not look like is has to go off line."
About 20 percent of Florida Power Corp's electricity flows from the Crystal River facility, which is the company's only nuclear power station.
Florida Power Corp is a subsidiary of Florida Progress Corp.
