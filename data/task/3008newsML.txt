Consumer Reports on Tuesday singled out two sports utility vehicles as having "too great a tendency to roll over in certain situations."
The consumer magazine said it rated the 1995 and 1996 Trooper (made by Isuzu Motors Ltd) and the 1996 Acura SLX (made by Honda Motor Co Ltd ) "not acceptable as a result.
Consumer Reports said that the sports trucks "tipped up high on two wheels" during a standard road test that simulates a car swerving to avoid an object on a highway.
