Philip Morris Cos Inc tested key support at 85-86, but technicians said all bets may be off for the next support level given major fundamental factors like the Indianapolis case, prospects of increased U.S. oversight and burgeoning litigation.
Morris was the most-active New York Stock Exchange issue and lost 1-3/8 to 86-3/8 after hitting a day-low 85-5/8.
"You can't judge anything. People are waiting for the case in Indiana. All hands are off (for the next level of support if key support is broken here). Obviously whatever way the jury goes, so will go the stock," said William Raftery, technical analyst at Smith Barney.
Closing arguments for the latest key tobacco liability case began Thursday morning at the Marion County Superior Court in Indianapolis. The jury is expected to get the case by week's end. Morris and other tobacco shares were hammered just a couple of weeks ago when a Florida jury ruled against the industry. Morris was at 105 before the Florida verdict.
Morris "is short-term oversold but the stock acts crummy. The stock should have bounced after the big break on the Florida litigation news," said Alfred Goldman, technical research director at A.G. Edwards.--Betty Wong 212 859 1721
