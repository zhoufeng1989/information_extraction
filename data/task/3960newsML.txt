Cargolux, the Luxembourg-based all-cargo carrier, has launched a scheduled freighter service operating between Manchester Airport to Hartford (Connecticut), a Manchester Airport statement said.
The Boeing 747-200 freighter will fly once weekly on the Luxembourg-Manchester-Hartford route and from Hartford- Manchester-Luxembourg, three times a week, the statement added.
This is the first time Cargolux has operated scheduled services into Manchester Airport, although it has operated ad hoc flights previously, said the airport's cargo business development manager, Gordon Bevan said.
The service began yesterday and hi-tech equipment will be the major equipment, he added.
With a 100 tonne capacity, the B747-200F is actually an Atlas Air aircraft, although previously it s belonged to Cargolux, Bevan said.
"The start of this Cargolux service is another positive development in achieving "open skies' for Manchester. It is madness to apply for permission at ministerial level for individual routes and we will continue to lobby for completely unrestricted access to the airport," Geoff Muirhead, Manchester Airport's chief executive said.
Cargolux is the airport's second B747 freighter service. Air Hong Kong currently operates five freighters a week into Manchester but this is likely to increase to six in the near future, added Bevan. --Air Cargo Newsroom Tel +44 171 542 8982 Fax +44 171 542 5017
