AM International Inc said Wednesday it reached a definitive agreement to sell its 2,148,000 shares of AM Japan Co Ltd to JAC Co Ltd, a Japanese marketing firm, and its president, Shigeru Watanabe.
AM International's shares represent about 66.3 percent of the outstanding shares of AM Japan, which markets graphic arts equipment, supplies and services. In fiscal 1995, AM Japan generated net income of $400,000 and revenues of $34 million.
The definitive agreement provides for a tender offer for the shares of AM Japan at a price of 575 yen per share (about $5.33 per share at current exchange rates).  
A letter of intent covering the transaction had been previously reached.
The parties expect the tender offer to begin in about one week and the transaction to close in late September.
AM Japan would continue to distribute AM International products.
In other action, AM International said a proposed sale of its Sheridan Systems division to Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG of Heidelberg, Germany received clearance to proceed under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.
AM International said it expects the transaction will close shortly after a special meeting of its stockholders for the approval of the transaction. The meeting is scheduled to be held on August 26, 1996.
