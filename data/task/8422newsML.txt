Norwegian state oil company Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap AS (Statoil) said on Thursday Danish authorities had delayed the award of exploration licences off West Greenland until October.
"When applications were due on February 29, the Danish authorities hoped to hand out acreage in the summer," the company's Status Weekly newsletter said.
Five oil companies -- Phillips Petroleum, Denmark's Dopas, Total, Elf and Statoil -- had applied for licences in the Fylla exploration area, Statoil said.
"We're reasonably confident that awards will be made this autumn," said Svein Larsen, head of Statoil Efterforskning & Produktion in Denmark.
