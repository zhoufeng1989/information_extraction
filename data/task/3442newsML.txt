The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) said on Wednesday it expected earnings to be flat in the year to June 30, 1997 but that earnings per share should improve as a result of the completion of a share buy-back.
"The bank expects that the payout ratio of dividends to earnings per share will be maintained in 1996/97, provided that there are no significant changes to the bank's business activities," the bank said in a statement accompanying its 1995/96 results.
