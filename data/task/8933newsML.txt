Dusquesne Light Co's 810 megawatt Beaver Valley nuclear power unit 1 resumed electricity production Thursday after being taken off line August 5 for repairs, a company spokesman said.
"We were back on line at 1000 (EDT)," spokesman Dennis O'Neil said Thursday. O'Neil declined to comment on when the unit likely would reach full production.
Beaver Valley, located in Shippingport, Pa., was shut to repair a reactor coolant pump.
DQE, Duquesne's parent company, owns 47.5 percent of Beaver Valley 1, with the remaining 52.5 percent held by Ohio Edison Co.
