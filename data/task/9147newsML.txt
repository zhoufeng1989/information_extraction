The Association of Russian Banks did not expect a banking crisis this year with unprofessional banks leaving the market, the association's president Sergei Yegorov said on Thursday.
"Structural changes are going on with difficulty," he told a news conference. "But the situation both in the economy and the banking sector is not such that it can lead to a crisis."
The central bank has been imposing a temporary administration on a new bank almost every week and has withdrawn licences from dozens of small- and medium-sized banks every month.
One of the most recent licence withdrawals was Russia's 17th biggest bank by assets, Tveruniversalbank. That move helped fuel fears of a new banking crisis.
Though Yegerov did not predict a banking crisis, the head of another large bank, Promstroibank RF, said Russia needed a national restructuring programme for its banks.
Yakov Dubenetsky, Promstroibank chairman, said Russia needed a national banks savings programme.
"The banking system is more dependent on the general economic situation than other spheres of economy," Dubenetsky told the news conference.
"It is high time to think about a banking system restructuring programme," Dubenetsky said.
This could involve banks restructuring former state-owned company debts and recieving equity instead of the debts, he said.
