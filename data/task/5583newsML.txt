British Petroleum's cat craker, shut down by a fire last week, is expected to remain out of action another 10 days, traders said on Wednesday.
"The cracker is still down. It looks likely to stay down until the end of August," a trader said, noting that Midwest gasoline prices have been especially strong.
The cat cracker, with a capacity of 38,500 barrels per day (bpd), was shut after a fire broke out last Thursday at the base of the cat cracker unit.
Crude traders said BP's Lima unit was out selling prompt crude, linking it to the loss of overall capacity.
"They have been marketing crude out of Lima and at other locations. They probably don't have much tankage," a Midwest trader said.
BP declined to comment on the status of its cat cracker.
"We are not commenting on refinery operations," a BP spokeswoman said.
The Lima refinery has an overall capacity of 155,000 bpd.
