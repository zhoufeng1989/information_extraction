Tunisia has launched an international tender for the establishment of a GSM cellular phone network all around the country, officials said on Tuesday.
The tender by state-run Office National des Telecommunications called "Tunisie Telecom" is for delivery, installation, bringing on line and acceptance of work done, they said.
Tunisia in 1994 signed with Northern Telecom Inc, a U.S.-based subsidiary of Canada's Northern Telecom Inc, a $40 million contract for the establishment of a GSM trial switch limited to Tunis only, in addition to the installation of 360,000 lines of Digital Multiplex System (DMS) switches.
