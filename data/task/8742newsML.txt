Shares in paging company MobileMedia Corp fell 7/8 or 10 percent to close at 7-5/8 after news that S&P downgraded the debt rating at a subsidiary to CCC from B-minus and said further cuts may take place.
Corporate credit ratings were cut to single B-minus from single B-plus. About $460 million of debt is affected.
MobileMedia, heavily indebted like most of the paging sector, is the second largest company in the sector with 4.4 million pagers. S&P said the parent company must issue $100 million of debt or equity by the year end to avoid a technical default on the credit facility.
Paging stocks have been under a cloud for almost a year, with many players hit by either by delays in new services, worries about pricing pressures, breaches of banking covenants or management turmoil.
On top of this some analysts are divided about whether new wireless telephones will include many paging features and undermine growth. -- Nick Louth, New York Newsroom  212 859 1712
