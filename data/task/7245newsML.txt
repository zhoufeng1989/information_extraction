Steel and Tube Ltd said on Wednesday its lower profit reflected its divestment of Motorcorp Holdings in June 1995.
It also reflected the negative impact of the cyclical downturn in the forest products industry on the profit results of A.J. Forsyth and Co Ltd, in which Steel and Tube bought a 51 percent stake in November 1995.
Steel and Tube earlier reported an annual net profit of NZ$25.3 million, down from $27.4 million last year.
Sales increased by $19.4 million to $355.1 million.  
The directors declared a final dividend of 20 cents per share, bringing the total dividend for the year to 40 cents per share.
Steel & Tube is just over half owned by Tubemakers of Australia.
