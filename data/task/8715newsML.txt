UAL Corp said its United Airlines unit ordered 27 new wide-body aircraft from Boeing Co valued at about $3.5 billion.
The Boeing order is for 19 jumbo-sized 747-400s, six 757s and two 777s. The airline confirmed that it had additionally ordered 24 new narrow-body A319 aircraft from Airbus Industrie for about $900 million.
The order values quoted by United are based on manufacturers' list prices, the airline said.
"United benefited from substantial discounts to the prices from both manufacturers," it said.  
United said the planes will be part of its "retire and replace" program to update its fleet. "By 2000, the program is expected to generate more than $100 million in annual operating cost savings, reducing fuel, maintenance and labor costs," United said.
The program will also ensure that United meets certain noise reduction requirement.
Delivery of all aircraft is scheduled to take place by 2002, United said.  
United also said it placed orders with Pratt & Whitney and International Aero Engines AG for engines to power the new jetliners. United Technologies Corp owns all of Pratt & Whitney and 33 percent of International Aero Engines.
