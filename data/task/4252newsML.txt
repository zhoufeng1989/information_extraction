Tylan General Inc said Monday it expects to post a net loss in the third quarter because of increased legal and investment-banking fees and continued rescheduling of orders by its customers.
The company also will be taking a one-time charge of $4.1 million from its acquisition of Span Instruments. Tylan also will take a restructuring charge of about $150,000 from recent staff reductions.
Including those nonrecurring items, the company expects to report a net loss per share of between $0.20 and $0.22 for the quarter. Excluding those items, the company expects earnings per share to be between $0.10 and $0.12 for the third quarter, which ended July 28.
The third-quarter results are expected to be released Aug 28.
