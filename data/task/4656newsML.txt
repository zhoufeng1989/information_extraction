A consortium of five small- and medium-sized South Korean construction companies has agreed in principle to take over debt-ridden Kun Young Construction Corp, an official at Dongsung Construction said on Tuesday.
The consortium also helped the home builder avoid bankruptcy by extending gaurantees to meet debt payments due on Tuesday afternoon, he said.
Dongsung will lead the consortium to buy out Kun Young, followed by unlisted Hankook Construction Engineering Co, Youngnam Construction Co, Dongbo Construction Co, and Kilhoon Construction Co.  
It has until Tuesday afternoon to make the payments before facing bankruptcy.
The Dongsung official said Kun Young would be able to meet its deadline. "We helped Kun Young escape going bust as we promised to give it a payment guarantee for the promissory notes," he said.
Kun Young narrowly escaped bankruptcy in early August when SEOULBANK extended it emergency loans to avoid defaulting on debt payments.
