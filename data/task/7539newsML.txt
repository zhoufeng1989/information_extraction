Finnish state-owned commercial bank Postipankki Oy said in a statement on Wednesday it expected a profit in the second half of the year, but weaker than the 462 million markka in the first half.
"The second half of the current year is estimated to be weaker than the early year but still show a profit. The full year will mark a substantial result improvement compared to previous years of losses," it said.  
"According to CEO Eino Keinanen, no growth is expected in volumes or returns, so Postipankki will have to safeguard its profitability by adjusting operational costs to expected returns and by improving cost-efficiency," it said.
The second quarter was weaker than the first when securities trading showed an exceptionally strong result, the bank said.
Second quarter securities trading showed a small loss since the bank moved forward some costs earlier treated as accruals due to tighter control of derivatives, it said.
The April-June operating profit was 107 million markka against 355 million markka in the first quarter, it said.
Credit demand was becoming slightly livelier and a long fall in the stock of credits to households seemed to have ended in the early summer, Postipankki said.
