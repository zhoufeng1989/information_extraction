Rickel Home Centers Inc said Thursday it plans to close 18 stores by the end of the year in a cost-cutting measure in the midst of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
The company said the stores that are being targeted, all of which are in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York, are unprofitable.
Once the 18 stores are closed, Rickel will continue to operate 48 other stores. Previously, the company announced that four other stores would be shutdown.
The closings are subject to approval by bankruptcy court.
