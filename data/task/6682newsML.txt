The UK's Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) said on Wednesday it was "extremely disappointed" by gas industry regulator Ofgas's final price proposals for British Gas unit TransCo.
"Energy intensive companies need internationally competitive energy prices to maintain their global market position," said EIUG chairman Ian Blakey in a statement.
"They have made an excessive contribution to British Gas' undeserved profitability since privatisation, and this control will continue to allow TransCo to charge over the odds for their monopoly pipeline".
EIUG combines 10 industry trade federations.
Ofgas published its final price proposals on Wednesday morning. According to Ofgas data, large firms -- defined as those using more than 300,260 therms a year -- now face an average annual gas bill of 567,000 stg.
TransCo's share of this, based on a notional transport route from Bacton in Norfolk to the West Midlands, is 25 percent.
In the first year of price controls, this bill will fall to 539,104 stg, a saving of 27,896 stg, if the Ofgas proposals are accepted. And in the year 2001/2002, the average bill for this group will be 511,835 stg, a saving from current levels of 55,165 stg, according to Ofgas.
While EIUG complains that the proposed cuts are too weak, British Gas argues that they are too draconian.
