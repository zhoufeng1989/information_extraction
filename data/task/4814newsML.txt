South Korea's debt-ridden Kun Young Construction Corp has agreed "in principle" to be taken over by unlisted Dongsung Construction Co Ltd, the domestic Yonhap News agency reported on Tuesday.
Neither Kun Young nor Dongsung would comment on the reports.  
Kun Young had been in takeover talks with Cheiljedang, but Yonhap reported that discussions had broken down.
Brokers said the companies had disagreed over the evaluation of Kun Young's assets.
Kun Young's shares have been halted for trading because it defaulted on 1.26 billion won worth of promissory notes late Monday. It has until Tuesday afternoon to make the payments before facing bankruptcy.
The shares closed on Monday at 5,020 won.
Kun Young owed 550 billion won to financial institutions as of the end of July.
