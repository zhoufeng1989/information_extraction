Britain's Rentokil Group Plc said on Thursday it aims to change its company name to Rentokil Initial Plc.
The move comes after the 2.1 billion stg acquisition of rival BET, which brought with it the Initial brand name, earlier in the year.
"It is proposed to change the name of the company...to reflect the plans to develop two international brands, Rentokil and Initial," the firm said in its first half results statement.
