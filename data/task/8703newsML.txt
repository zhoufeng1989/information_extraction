AT&T Corp said Thursday that the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approved its application to offer local phone service in most of the state's counties.
Earlier this year, AT&T said it filed its application with the commission requesting a certificate to provide local telephone service in areas of the state currently served by Ameritech Corp and GTE Corp.
Earlier this month, AT&T said it asked the commission to arbitrate its negotiations with those companies regarding Ohio local service.
Under the terms of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the commission has until November 27 to reach a decision in the arbitration case with Ameritech and until December 12 in the case with GTE.
