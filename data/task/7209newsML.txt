Grocery retailer Woolworths Ltd said on Wednesday it saw a continued tough retail environment over the current 1996/97 year.
"We're going to have a fairly tough retail environment," Woolworths managing director Reg Clairs told a news conference.  
Earlier Woolworths reported a 0.04 percent rise in year net profit to A$233.6 million after sales growth of 9.35 percent to A$13.99 billion in the 52 weeks to June 23.
Clairs said competitors would try to fight back through the year.
"Hopefully we've shown we've got all our ducks in a row to make a good strong growth pattern in the year ahead," he said.
Clairs said he did not see any immediate flow on into the retail market from the July 31 cut in official interest rates or the A$3.90 billion of budget cuts announced on Tuesday.  
"I can't see anything that's going to immediately change the pre-disposition to spend in the community," he said.
"It will take some months for that to filter through."
Woolworths share price closed up four cents at A$3.01.
