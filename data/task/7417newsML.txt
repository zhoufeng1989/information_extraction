Expensive investments, poor quality controls and inefficiency are affecting the profitability of China's light industry, the China Daily said on Wednesday.
China's light industry has grown at around 13.2 percent a year over the past five years, but this was still far behind fixed asset investment in the sector, which had risen by an annual average of 20 percent, the newspaper said.
Exorbitant investments, high costs, low yields, inferior quality and inefficiency continued to plague the sector, it quoted Wang Lizheng of the China National Council of Light Industry as saying.
In the first three months of the year, deficits incurred by the entire sector rose to 615 million yuan ($74 million) and 40.66 percent of enterprises were in the red, China Daily said but gave no comparative figures or more recent figures.
Wang was quoted as saying light industrial firms needed to emphasise technological development and curb over-investment.  
The deputy director of the council's Planning and Development Department added that enterprises should be encouraged to be innovative and the light industry council should reform its own management to boost the independence of state-owned firms.
The majority of the council's subordinate enterprises should be transformed into shareholding companies, he said but gave no details.
