Konica Corp said on Tuesday its parent current profit would be at least five billion yen in the six months to September 30.
Konica said earlier this year that its parent current profit for the first half of 1996/97 would be five billion yen against actual current profit of 2.39 billion yen a year ago.
"This term's current profit will not fall below five billion yen," a Konica spokesman said. The expected profit rise is due to the weaker yen, cost-cutting steps and active sales of photographic film, he said. Half-year sales are expected at 180 billion yen, up seven percent from a year ago.
