A spokesman for Diana Corp said the company continues to work with an investment banker on strategic alternatives, but did not know why its stock price was up 9-1/4 to 30-1/2 in late trading.
"It's hard to comment on the day-to-day movement of stock prices," said Tony Squeglia, spokesman for Chatsworth, Calif.-based Sattel Communications, a 95-percent owned unit of Diana. Squeglia said he was speaking on Diana's behalf.  
Diana continues to work with investment banker Hambrecht & Quist to evaluate strategic alternatives, Squeglia said.
He called baseless one market rumor that a secondary stock offering is in the works.
Top executives at Milwaukee-based Diana could not be reached because they were on their way to Chatsworth for Diana's annual meeting there on Thursday, a secretary said.
Diana said July 26 it had hired Hambecht & Quist and added that one alternative under evaluation was the separation of different business units.  
Diana, a telecommunications equipment maker, said in June it planned to sell its wholesale meat and seafood operations, but said those plans could be reevaluated as part of a larger restructuring if a buyer was not found promptly.
Shares in Diana are on a roller-coaster ride. Trading in the low teens in January and February, the shares skyrocketed to 120 in early summer, then plunged to the 20s in July.
