U.S. HomeCare Corp said on Thursday its common stock was removed from the Nasdaq National Market.
The company said it will be listed on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market effective Aug. 22. The listing is pursuant to a waiver to the bid price requirement for initial listing on the market, the company said.
U.S. HomeCare said it was removed from the National Market because of the company's inability to meet the net tangible assets requirement.
