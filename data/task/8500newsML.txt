NOTE - Full name of Norway's biggest forestry company is Norske Skogindustrier ASA. Eight analysts polled by Reuters forecast a first-half operating result of 1,181 million crowns. The company said it expected second half results to be weaker partly because of the weakening of the markets for SC and newsprint.
