-- Merrill Lynch & Co said it was maintaining its neutral rating on Brazilian steelmaker Cosipa after the release of the company's first-half earnings.
-- But it said it raised its 1996 loss estimate for the company to 99.5 million reais from 6.3 million reais.
-- "A delay in the restarting of Cosipa's main blast furnace after a preventive refurbishment resulted in a very poor (second) quarter," Merrill Lynch said.
-- The delay reinforces the perception that Cosipa is "still mired in operational problems," it added.  
-- Cosipa posted a second-quarter loss of 103 million reais versus Merrill Lynch's forecast of a loss of 10 million reais.
-- "We believe short-term appeal of the stock remains limited," the brokerage said.
-- On the Sao Paulo stock exchange, Cosipa preferred stock was down 0.02 at 0.48 reais and its voting common was unchanged at 0.51 reais at 1335 local/1635 GMT.
