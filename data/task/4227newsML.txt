Newcor Inc said Tuesday it has a good outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter that began August 1, since customer requirements for the parts produced by the components and assemblies segment are generally strong during this period.
It added that its special machines segment assembly and ship schedules are forecast to be much higher compared with the third quarter, and start-up and integration costs will not be as high as they were in the third quarter.
Earlier, Newcor reported third quarter earnings of $0.13 a share, compared with earnings from continuing operations of $0.05 a year ago.
Newcor added that there is a "good level" of interest in its Machine Tool and Eonic divisions. As previously announced, the divisions are being sold.
