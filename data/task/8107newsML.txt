National Shipping Company of Saudi Arabia (NSCSA) on Thursday said it would take delivery this week of a third very large crude carrier (VLCC) under construction in Japan.
A company statement said NSCSA officials would on Friday attend a ceremony in Japan to name the ship Watban, which is being built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan.
NSCSA, traded in the Saudi market, has awarded Mitsubishi a deal worth about $400 million to build five crude supertankers as part of an expansion plan.
NSCSA, 28.8 percent owned by the Saudi government, has already taken delivery of two ships and the remaining vessels are due for delivery by the middle of January 1997.
"This very large crude carrier is capable of making a return voyage to the Arabian Gulf via USA without refuelling. Its load is distributed in 17 loading tanks in addition to the ballast tanks," the statement said.
