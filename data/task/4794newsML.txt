Shenzhen-listed air-conditioner maker Guangdong Meide Holdings Co Ltd said on Tuesday its first half net 1996 profits fell to 68.79 million yuan from 98.28 million yuan last year.
The company said in an interim report in the Shenzhen-based Securities Times that according to Chinese accounting standards, main operating income totalled 1.67 billion yuan against 1.03 billion yuan a year earlier.
Meide blamed the earnings plunge on sharper competition which forced it to reduce prices on a range of products.
But it said, sales of air conditioners had risen 70 percent in the first half and expects higher production and sales of electric fans and cooking appliances to result in improved profits for 1996.
Meide reported after-tax profits of 81.82 million yuan last year. Earnings per share slid 40.91 percent to 0.39 yuan from 0.66 yuan in 1994. -- HONG KONG NEWSROOM (852) 2843-6441
