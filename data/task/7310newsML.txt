Shares of COSCO Pacific Ltd were lower on Wednesday, despite a firmer market tone, on concerns about the impact of direct shipping links between Taiwan and China, brokers said.
"There is slight concern about news that Taiwan and China will allow direct shipping," said Miles Remington, sales trader at Crosby Securities. "If that does happen it may affect China shipments in Hong Kong and may affect earnings (of local shipping companies)."
COSCO shares fell HK$0.15 to HK$5.85 in late trade.
China issued rules on Tuesday governing direct shipping links with Taiwan. Edwin Cheung, a sales manager from Taiwan Securities, said COSCO was hit because of its significant involvement in shipping between Taiwan and China.
However, some analysts said they expected COSCO's container leasing business to receive a boost over the longer run from increasing demand by its parent China Ocean Shipping Co which has a near monopoly over China's international shipping routes.
Shares in Orient Overseas (International) Ltd, another shipping group, were unchanged at HK$5.70.
