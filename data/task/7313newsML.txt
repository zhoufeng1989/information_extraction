Plaza Create Co Ltd, an operator of photo film processing shops, said on Wednesday that it had agreed to purchase U.S. optical products wholesaler Vivitar Inc and its three group firms for $36 million.
Plaza Create, which listed on the over-the-counter market on July 23, plans to acquire Vivitar Inc and its group firms in France, Hong Kong and Japan on September 30, it said in a statement.
All of the shares of Vivitar and its group firms are currently held by Gestetner Holdings Plc and its group firms.
Concurrently, Plaza Create's European subsidiary will take over part of the marketing operations at Vivitar (Europe) Ltd.
Plaza Create said it hopes to market optical products under the brand name of Vivitar through its network of photo processing shops in the future.
The company said it expects to receive 130 million yen as a dividend from the Vivitar group firms in fiscal year 1996/97.
