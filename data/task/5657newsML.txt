Temple-Inland Forest Products Corp and Canada's Re-Con Building Products Inc said in a joint statement on Wednesday that they formed a venture to build and operate a cement fiberboard plant south of Dallas/Fort Worth.
The plant is expected to cost approximately $60 million to $70 million, a Temple-Inland spokesman said.
Ownership of the venture is split evenly between Temple-Inland and Re-Con Building, the spokesman said. Re-Con Building is a unit of The Clarke Group, Temple-Inland said.
The plant will be able to produce approximately 240 million square feet per year of cement fiberboard siding and related products and will employ about 90 people, Temple-Inland said.
