Brown Disc Products Co said Wednesday that it knew of no reason for a drop in its share price and that its merger with 3SI Inc was on track.
"There have been no material developments that may have caused the drop in its share price," Ronald Cole, Brown Disc's chairman and chief executive officer said in a news release.
Brown Disc was down 13/16 at 1-3/4 late Wednesday afternoon.
Brown Disc said on August 9 it was in talks with a New York investment banking company regarding a secondary stock offering.
Also on August 9, the company said a definitive agreement to merge with 3SI Inc, signed on May 15, was extended to September 15, so that long-term financing issues relating to the deal could be restructured in light of the secondary offering.
