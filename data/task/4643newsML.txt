Fuji Photo Film Co Ltd said on Tuesday that it would launch disposable cameras based on Advanced Photo System technology in the United States as early as September.
"Since our APS products caught on very quickly in Japan when they were introduced in April, we are hoping to see the same thing happen in the United States, the world's largest market," a company spokesman said.
He did not give a sales target for the disposable cameras.
The APS, launched worldwide on April 22, uses silver-based film with a smaller frame size than the standard 35 mm. Konica Corp, Japan's second largest film maker after Fuji Photo, introduced disposable APS cameras in the United States at the end of April, a Konica spokesman said.
He said these had yet to be widely accepted by U.S. consumers.
