European banks have agreed to remove $345 million worth of liens attached to Bezeq Israel Telecom income after negotiations with the company, Bezeq said in a statement.
The liens were a guarantee for loans the company obtained from these banks last year.
"The negotiations were fully successful due to the great confidence the banking community has in Bezeq," said Isaac Kaul, president of the company.
Until late 1995 Bezeq obtained loans from European banks by attaching, as guarantees for these loans, part of the income expected from international communication services.
Union Bank of Switzerland attached liens on Bezeq income of $300 million from U.S. communication companies for a loan to Bezeq. Other liens were attached by German banks from whom Bezeq received loans, the company said.
Bezeq vice president for finance, Avi Hochman, said that since late last year Bezeq secures loans on international capital markets without the need for liens.
He said that once these improved loans conditions were attained, without the liens, a certain lack of symmetry was created regarding the conditions under which the above loans were obtained and the company initiated negotiations for removing the liens on previous loans.
