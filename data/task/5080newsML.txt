Pay TV operator Australis Media Ltd said it had allotted 14.89 million shares as a result of the conversion of convertible notes.
The shares were issued in two tranches to two nominee companies, 276,900 shares to Calex Nominees Ltd and 14.6 million to Westpac Custodian Nominees Ltd.
No additional funds were received by the company as a result of the issue of the additional securities.  
On Tuesday, Australis announced financing details for its future operations, saying a consortium involving Kerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd (PBL) and Lenfest Communications Inc would provide the company with US$105 million of equity finance.
The fundraising commitments are subject to conditions which include the completion of a new U.S. offering and the equity raising in a combined minimum amount of US$250 million and U.S. bond holders' consent.
The company said it hoped to complete the new U.S. offering by October 1996.  
Australis shares closed 13 cents higher at 25 cents on turnover of 4.6 million shares on Wednesday after being reinstated following a suspension of trading since Monday.
