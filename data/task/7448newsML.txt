Shares of Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) were expected to resume trading on Wednesday, and dealers said they expect the stock to rise following the release of positive full-year earnings results.
Maybank shares were suspended on Tuesday and closed at 22.50 ringgit on Monday.
The country's largest bank on Tuesday reported net profit of 1.07 billion ringgit for the year ended June 30, 1996, against 863.53 million ringgit a year before. The profit figure was a shade above market expectations.
In addition, Maybank executives on Tuesday dispelled recent concerns about its exposure to loans from troubled companies Perwaja Steel and Amcol Holdings Ltd, saying the provisions are "insignificant."
"I think there will be some buying in Maybank today," said one dealer with a local brokerage firm.
