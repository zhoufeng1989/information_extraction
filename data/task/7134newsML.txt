Aker ASA said its Aker Marine division and Danish partner Maersk would begin towing the Anasuria production ship (FPSO) out to the U.K. North Sea Teal and Guillemot developments at the weekend.
The FPSO will be located midway between the two oil and gas fields, connected by 12 pre-installed mooring lines in a water depth of about 90 metres.
The fields, operated by Shell U.K., lie 150 km east of Aberdeen in blocks 21/25 and 21/30 of the central North Sea.
Each field will be tapped by satellite subsea wells tied back to a subsea manifold. Each manifold will be tied back to the FPSO.
A Shell spokesman said first oil would flow about six weeks after the ship's arrival at the fields. It was originally scheduled to start up in October.
