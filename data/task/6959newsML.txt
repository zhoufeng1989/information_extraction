Sequana Therapeutics Inc has formed a joint venture with New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in the field of cancer genetics.
In a statement late on Tuesday, Sequana said the venture would research and identify genes and related information that could lead to improved diagnostic tests and possible treatment for many cancers.
Sequana and Sloan-Kettering will each contribute an initial $5 million to fund the joint venture. A definitive agreement is expected to be concluded by the end of the year.
