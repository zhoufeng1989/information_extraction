-- Goldman Sachs analyst Rick Sherlund took Oracle Corp off its priority list and moved it down to its recommended list, his office said.  
-- Oracle had been on the brokerage's priority list for approximately one year.
-- In published comments, Sherlund said he had lowered Oracle's rating due to its sharp price appreciation.  
-- The stock closed at 39 Tuesday (corrects from Monday), near its year high of 42-1/8. Oracle shares were trading in the vicinity of 25 when Sherlund added the stock to Goldman's priority list last fall.
-- In his comments, Sherlund said Oracle's quarter ending later this month "appears to be a bit tighter than expected as new sales territories are assigned and quotas are established in Europe," a change he noted may not have gone smoothly.
-- Stll, he said he believes "a strong end-of-quarter push will likely permit the company to acheive our estimates for the quarter." The analyst's estimate for the first quarter ending in August stands at $0.17 per share currently.  
-- Sherlund said his rating change reflects the absence of a near-term catalyst for the stock, but he added that he remains very bullish on Oracle's prospects as dominant supplier of database management software and other products.
-- The analyst said he believes there is likely to be an upside to his full year earnings estimates as the seasonally stronger second half results arrive.
-- Sherlund's earnings estimate for the fiscal year ending in May 1997 is $1.25 per share.
-- Oracle stock had fallen 1-1/2 points to 37-1/2 just after the opening of trading Wednesday (corrects from Tuesday).
