Grammy Entertainment Plc on Wednesday attributed its bullish first half performance to sharp earnings growth of its main music tape and radio divisions.
Grammy president Paiboon Damrongchaitham said his entertainment firm's music tape sales rose 41 percent during January/June from a year ago while its radio business generated 27 percent sales growth.
Grammy's net profit rose to 261 million baht on 1.76 billion baht revenue in the first half from 227 million baht and 1.37 billion baht, respectively, a year earlier.
Its overall second quarter earnings surged to 143.9 million baht from 117 million baht a year earlier. Revenue rose to 929 million baht from 708 million.
Paiboon said Grammy expected to earn a minimum 500 million baht revenue from its new educational materials business through its joint venture with state-owned Sueksaphand chain stores.
