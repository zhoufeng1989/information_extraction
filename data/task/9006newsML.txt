Hong Kong and Taiwan-based airlines are planning autumn air cargo rates increases to their home markets from European centres, air cargo sources told Reuters said.
Air Hong Kong Ltd (AHK) plans "a small" ex-Europe to Hong Kong cargo rate increase from October and may be followed by Cathay Pacific AirWays Ltd,the latter's Dutch cargo manager said.
Achim van der Graaff, in a Reuters telephone interview from Amsterdam, said the AHK increases are planned for October 1.
"These are marginal increases and I think the market can accept a slightly higher price."
"If the AHK increase are accepted, Cathay may implement similar increases," said van der Graaff.
Cathay, which owns 75 percent of AHK is also its general sales agent in the Netherlands, in Zurich and Paris.
Van der Graaff said the usual April rates review earlier this year did not result in Cathay implementing a rate rise.
AHK chief operating officer, Stanley Hui, told Reuters on August 21 that rates on routes from Europe to Hong Kong will be raised "a little bit".
Taiwanese carrier, EVA Airways Corp said in London at end-July that it is seeking an increase of five to ten percent on all of its ex-Europe to Far East routes from mid-September.
A China Airlines source said today that winter schedule rises are being considered on the routes but "we will also wait and see what the market says."
Competition on routes to Hong Kong and Taipei has been very tough, said one source from a north Asian carrier, adding that it is not really surprising that rates increases are planned, as these are needed to try and rebuild yields. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel +44-171-542-7706 Fax+44-171-542-5017
