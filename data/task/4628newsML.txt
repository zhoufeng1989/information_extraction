Hansol Merchant Bank has mandated Credit Suisse and KDB Asia to arrange a US$40 million floating rate certificate of deposit issue, bankers said.
They said the facility has a final maturity of three years with annual put options and no call options. The issue will be priced at par.
An arranger group is being formed, bankers noted.
No futher details were available.
In March, the issuer launched a US$50 million FRCD.
The three-year facility was priced at par to float at 50 basis points over the six-month London Interbank Offered Rate.
With fees, the all-in return for top-tier managers was 66 basis points.
